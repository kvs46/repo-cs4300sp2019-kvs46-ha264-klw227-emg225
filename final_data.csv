to the audacious actions of engaged individualsFrom Tahrir Square to Zuccotti Park physical public space has aggressively reminded the world of its centrality in accommodating and nurturing political debate and protestPublic spaces come in many flavors They include cityowned streets sidewalks and parks In New York and other cities they also include a zoningcreated variety known as privately owned public space Through a technique known as incentive zoning New York since 1961 has encouraged developers of office and residential skyscrapers to provide a nowsubstantial array of more than 500 plazas arcades and indoor spaces in return for valuable zoning concessions The most valuable concession of all has been bonus floor area and the City has thus granted more than 20 million square feet of extra building area for developers Although the spaces differ in terms of the legal specifics that created them the signature requirement is that they be usable by the publicZuccotti Park is one such privately owned public space although referring to it as one in 500 understates the seismic role it is currently playing The many actors in this unfolding drama  the activists of Occupy Wall Street using the space spaceowner Brookfield Office Properties various agencies and officials of the Cityincluding the policeas well as neighbors and other members of the public have a stake in understanding the possibilities and limitations for continued occupation Initially at least such greater understanding requires unearthing and characterizing the specific legal actions that created the space Zuccotti Park owes its existence to an incentive zoning transaction memorialized in a 1968 Special Permit that traded zoning concessions other than a floor area bonus in return for this public space variously referred to as a plaza an open landscaped area with trees sitting areas and the necessary lighting and what amounts to a permanent open park in the heart of one of the most densely builtup areas in the world The Special Permit notes importantly that it is principally because of this public benefit that the Commission has viewed this application with favor Although the developer simultaneously secured a substantial floor area bonus for its office tower that bonus was actually for another plaza to the north that wraps around the tower and not for Zuccotti Park In 2005 the City approved an application from the current owner Brookfield to modify the space through such improvements as the planting of 55 honey locust trees the addition of 1010 linear feet of fixed seating 16 fixed tables with fixed seats an abstract steel sculpture and new lighting Brookfield also changed the name of the space from Liberty Park how prescient to Zuccotti Park after the companys  CoChairman John Zuccotti a highlyrespected New York City attorney and former Chair of the New York City Planning CommissionGiven its legal provenance how should one judge the current use of Zuccotti Park by the hundreds of people constituting Occupy Wall Street The true answer is no one knows Unlike most other outdoor privately owned public spaces in New York City Zuccotti Park is a oneoff sui generis as lawyers would say Zuccotti Park is simply what the Special Permit says it is a large and useful plaza that must have amenities of seating tables trees lighting and public art The nature of permissible public use including the legal authority of the owner to impose its own rules to govern the conduct of those within the space is undefined The Zoning Resolution does provide some comparative guidance with regard to four expressly defined categories of plazas including the plaza 1961 urban plaza 1975 residential plaza 1977 and public plaza 2007 Believe it or not different rules attach to each of these categories of plaza and their definitions reflect a relentless chronological march introducing tougher design and amenity requirements to remedy the evident inadequacies of spaces provided under existing law The grandparent of all privately owned public spaces the plain vanilla plaza introduced in the Citys 1961 Zoning Resolution initially required owners to make the space accessible to the public at all times but subsequent zoning amendments motivated in large measure by problems associated with overnight use of spaces by homeless individuals led the City to permit owners of the various plaza categories to apply for authorization for nighttime closings Many owners have applied for and secured such authorizationsNo one knows for sure what the owner of Zuccotti Park would like to do with its space although it hardly stretches the imagination to believe it may like Occupy Wall Street to well occupy Wall Street and not its park If it so desired could the owner legally dislodge Occupy Wall Street Could it for example apply for and receive an authorization from the City for a nighttime closing under existing law The answer is a clear and unambiguous maybe Under one reading of the law the answer is no Section 37727 of the Zoning Resolution states that the City Planning Commission may authorize the closing during certain nighttime hours of an existing or new publicly accessible open area if the Commission finds among other things that a such existing publicly accessible open area has been open to the public a minimum of one year or there are significant operational or safety issues documented and b such closing is necessary for public safety within the publicly accessible open area and maintenance of the public open areas as documented by the applicant But because the phrase publicly accessible open area is a defined term in the Zoning Resolution that refers to the four articulated plaza types plaza urban plaza residential plaza public plaza and since Zuccotti Park is none of the above this option could be understood as unavailable to the owner or City The spirit of the law and an accommodating City interpretation would suggest that owners of Zuccotti Park should enjoy the same ability to apply for an authorization of a nighttime closing as owners of similar plazas created pursuant to the existing zoning categoriesCould Brookfield impose its own rules of conduct that would limit or even prohibit Occupy Wall Street from using the space effectively rendering the current use a trespass To answer this question I need only quote a passage from Privately Owned Public Space The New York City Experience a book I wrote more than a decade ago in collaboration with the New York City Department of City Planning and the Municipal Art Society of New YorkThe Department of City Planning has taken the position that an owner may prescribe reasonable rules of conduct In determining the definition of reasonable the Department has looked to the rules of conduct applicable in Cityowned parks for general guidance Thus for example the Department has considered a dog leash requirement a ban on the consumption of alcoholic beverages or a prohibition on sleeping in an indoor space to be reasonable On the other hand suggestions by owners that they be allowed to exclude undesirable persons on some basis other than improper conduct or to set limits on the amount of time a member of the public may sit in or otherwise use a space have been considered unreasonableOther fact patterns have and will arise to help sharpen the notion of reasonablenessWhat about rules against listening to a radio playing a musical instrument or inline skating May an owner bar political candidates organizational representatives or activist individuals from seeking signatures for a petition or from handing out literatureThe open question remains then could the owner adopt a rule allowing it to oust or severely limit the activities of Occupy Wall Street Surely any rule crudely prohibiting political activity within the space should fail the reasonableness test And there is no need to impress the US Constitutions First Amendment Free Speech clause to support this argument especially since the First Amendment applies only to government not private action And if it did apply by deeming Brookfield effectively a government actor contentneutral rules regulating the time place and manner of political activity would likely be constitutionally legitimate Instead one need only recognize that there is hardly a more timehonored use of public space than as platform for political activity Cities are about expression of ideas and what better way even in this digital age to express ideas than to gather in one place body to body and express themIronically it is Occupy Wall Streets enormous success that presents the greatest legal challenge Its footprint of occupation is to state the obvious dominant Yes people unassociated with Occupy Wall Street may and do pass through the space wander about chat with movement members take photographs eat a sandwich and read a book But this recitation glosses over the reality that Zuccotti Park has been literally taken over by one group in a way that could easily mitigate the enjoyment of the public space by other members of the public For those seeking the quiet passive enjoyment of what had been they are out of luck For other groups political or otherwise that may be inspired to seek a public space home of their own think political competitors flash mobs organized skateboarders they face a no vacancy sign Brookfields privately owned public space has become privately owned de facto by Occupy Wall StreetThis should not I hope offend Occupy Wall Street Its members are equally members of the public with a right to use Zuccotti Park and they have exercised that right with civility humanity and conviction But as time goes by they should ask themselves whether in satisfying their own needs they are preventing multiple publics from doing the same First in time should not become first in right now and forever more One potential solution would involve a scheduled reduction of their footprint over time freeing up part of the space for other users After all Speakers Corner in Londons Hyde Park is just that a corner of Hyde Park Spatial pluralism may be a dilution but it respectfully responds to the needs of many publics seeking to take advantage of Zuccotti ParkThe City privately owned public space owners and their representatives civic groups like the Municipal Art Society and other interested individuals should seize the moment to commence a public conversation on how best to utilize New Yorks remarkable archipelago of plazas arcades and indoor spaces scattered throughout downtown midtown and the upper east and west sides of Manhattan As recounted in Privately Owned Public Space far too many of these spaces have been disappointments effectively orphaned by private and public inattention or worse Brookfield is not an absentee parent but conceptually Occupy Wall Street may be one of the first to recognize that an orphan is a terrible thing to wasteThat doesnt mean however that political occupation is the palliative  To be fair most of these spaces are modest neither designed nor equipped for the robust mass engagement represented by Occupy Wall Streets use of Zuccotti Park For spaces that can accommodate larger groups it may now be time to develop citywide rules governing organizational use so that everyone gets a fair shake  Such approaches are routinely applied in a citys publicowned realm worldwide With the vastness of the inventory not every space has to accommodate every type of public use  If the outcome of Occupy Wall Streets use of Zuccotti Park results in a discussion about uses of and improvements to public space then its members could add yet another accomplishment to their already impressive achievementsProfile from Privately Owned Public Space The New York City Experience by Jerold S Kayden The New York City Department of City Planning and the Municipal Art Society of New York John Wiley  Sons 2000 Because this profile was published in 2000 it may not accurately reflect current conditionsThe relationship between this office building and a major portion of its public space diverges from the Corbusian tower in the park archetype Unlike the plaza at 140 Broadway across the street this special permit plaza stands alone a fullblock rectangular park bounded by Broadway Cedar Street Trinity Place and Liberty Street liberated from its host office tower by Liberty Street The difference this makes is most keenly understood visually Whereas 140 Broadway gains its architectural clarity by rising straight and uninterrupted from the middle of its capacious gradelevel plaza One Liberty Plaza does not rely on its disconnected plaza for visual definitionCalled Liberty Park the special permit plaza slopes downward from Broadway to Trinity Place Its linear geometry tightly regimented rows of mature trees protected at their roots by square metal grates and ubiquitous stone paving are more redolent of urban than naturalistic landscapes Eight metal benches are regularly used by passersby especially when the weather is hot and the shade of the trees entices On closer examination one of the bench occupants is revealed to be a bronze sculpture entitled Double Check by J Seward Johnson Jr an artist who specializes in bronze lifesize sculptures installed in public places Judging from the startled reaction of plaza users the sculpture could be entitled Double TakeAn elevated ribbon of plaza encircles the fullblock host building above Broadway and Liberty Church and Cortlandt Streets Numerous stairwells and planters provide informal seating opportunities especially along Cortlandt Street Access to the subway is provided at the intersection of Church and Cortlandt Streets ,

1251 Avenue of the Americas,https://apops.mas.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/2012-1251_Sixth_Ave-d-e1351197054227.jpg,Manhattan,24,No required amenities,,-73.981612,40.759971,1251 Sixth Avenue,1.33,POPS,10020,This plaza is the northernmost of three titanic privately owned public spaces that occupy a threeblock stretch along the west side of Sixth Avenue from West 47th to 50th Streets in front of skyscrapers built for corporate headquarters From south to north are the approximately 20000squarefoot space at 1211 Sixth Avenue formerly the Celanese building the approximately 37000 square feet of space at the McGrawHill building and this almost 30000squarefoot plaza at what once was known as the Standard Oil and Exxon buildings Each public space was built in the early 1970s as part of the Rockefeller Center development complex each was designed by the same architecture firm Harrison and Abramovitz each was conceived and executed in contemplation of the other two and each boldly projected the view of New York City as a center of corporate power Unexpectedly their collective presence ignited a firestorm of criticism over the 1961 Zoning Resolutions legal embrace of the tower in the park conceptThe problem was not inherent in the idea that a dense urban core like midtown Manhattan would need breathing spaces Indeed several blocks to the east Mies van der Rohes 1958 Seagram Building with its elegant plaza and duet of flanking fountains on Park Avenue between East 52nd and 53rd Streets remains the citys quintessential International Style masterpiece of tower in the park architecture as well as a strong element of urban design But one must wonder how the Seagram space and Park Avenue itself would have fared had adjoining parcels mimicked the Seagram design The very contrast of neighboring buildings and massings from McKim Mead  Whites masonry lowrise Racquet and Tennis Club across the street to the angled floating tower of Skidmore Owings  Merrills Lever House to the less distinguished but pleasantly differentiated buildings to the north and south on the east side of Park Avenue help secure Seagrams legacyTo many urban observers the 1961 Zoning Resolutions de facto reliance on the massing of the Seagram Building as a model for its highdensity commercial district zoning envelope was mistaken These observers argued that the asofright license granted to developers to replicate without regard to neighborhood context the towerplaza typology in return for a 101 zoning bonus ruined this part of Sixth Avenue as well as other areas of the city The plazas substituted vacant windswept spaces for buildings built to the front lot line destroying a sense of visual containment and allowing a grievous hemorrhaging of street energy otherwise fostered by retail frontage and constrained sidewalks Although not every observer had such a negative view of the Sixth Avenue spaces  indeed some admired their aesthetic presence others their perimeter treatment along the sidewalk that engendered substantial sitting on ledges  the basic critique persevered and culminated in substantial plaza zoning reform in 1975 that would generally prohibit the plaza typology of the Sixth Avenue groupingHere a large bright turquoise pool dominates the space Water jets spray upward at the center and water spills down at back to a slender lower level Ledge seating at front and back permits physical contact with the water In good weather the Sixth Avenue ledge is packed with people backs to the water eyes glued to the choreography of pedestrians and moving vehicles on the sidewalk and street Although the size and presentation of the pool are impressive they raise a question about how open and accessible to the public or how usable a public space is if it is largely covered by water landscaping or other elements that prevent physical access According to the original 1961 Zoning Resolutions definition of an asofright plaza ornamental fountains    shall be considered permitted obstructions One that covers this much of a space however pushes the concept Indeed without a narrow corridor between the back of the pool and the front of the building a corridor that from time to time has been blocked by planters pedestrians would have as much difficulty crossing this space as if the tower itself had been built to its front lot line Other spaces that have installed huge amounts of landscaping with like effect raise similar questions about predominantly visual as opposed to physically usable asofright plazas Physical usability here at least is supplied along the fountain edge at the sidewalk and at north and south ends of the plaza fronting Sixth Avenue where elevated rectangular terraces furnish benches trees and planting These terraces are similar to the ones one block south at the McGrawHill building flanking its sunken plaza More plaza space extends westward along West 49th and 50th Streets in front of the building entrancesThe space at the back of 1251 Sixth Avenue is about to undergo an identity change of potentially longterm benefit to the public The issue at least in recent years has not been the quality of the space a verdant parklike area known as Exxon Park between West 49th and 50th Streets In what has been a surprising revelation to many public space experts however the park never was part of the buildings privately owned public space A declaration of easements covenants and restrictions made by the owner in December 1986 described it as a park plaza or pedestrian mall but expressly reserved its use principally to persons connected with this building and not to the general public Thus although it has been heavily used by members of the general public for many years it was never obligated to be open to the public by zoning rules All this will change however when the proposed world headquarters for Morgan Stanley Dean Witter  Company at 745 Seventh Avenue is constructed on the lot to the west along West 50th Street The developer of that site obtained a City special permit obligating it to reconstruct this space according to a new design approved by the City Planning Commission During the construction phase of the building the space will be closed to the public and will reopen when the building is ready for occupancy The profile for 745 Seventh Avenue shows an image of that future spaceUntil construction begins and if the existing space is maintained for public use then it is certainly worth a visit The West 49th Street side is lined with tables and chairs used by a restaurant to the east and wooden planters and benches to the west The West 50th Street side takes advantage of the extra area created by a recess in the back of the building and provides two zones of activity In one the focus is on food Two kiosks face each other and offer refreshment for users seated at café tables and chairs arrayed on a raised wooden platform The area to the east is for quieter activities Mature trees and wooden benches furnish a rustic quality A waterwall and pool tacked onto the back of the building mask noise and are easily approached down several steps A sculpture by J Seward Johnson Jr called Out to Lunch 1980 sets the right example a seated man is eating a sandwich and reading a book about offshore saltwater fly fishingA combination of public and private spaces at the backs of Sixth Avenue towers creates a fourblock midblock pedestrian network starting from the landscaped pedestrian plaza at Stevens Tower and ending here It is also worth noting that the Sixth Avenue plaza to the north and in front of the TimeLife Building between West 50th and 51st Streets was built before the 1961 Zoning Resolutions plaza provision and never received a bonus,

Avenue,2.33,POPS,10019,Public spaces at PaineWebber reflect lessons learned from the indiscriminate provision of huge setback plazas on the west side of Sixth Avenue during the late 1960s and early 1970s Under the original provisions of the 1961 Zoning Resolution the PaineWebber building would have been able to construct asofright a 24000squarefoot plaza on Sixth Avenue that would have generated almost a quartermillion square feet of bonus floor area like the plazas in front of 1251 Sixth Avenue McGrawHill and 1211 Sixth Avenue to the south What may have worked on an individual lot however became problematic when replicated in series Nurtured by building street wall continuity retail frontage bounded public sidewalks and density of pedestrian traffic the avenues urban vitality was disturbed when the three plazas appeared next to one another For some this was the end of Sixth Avenues aspiration to great street status Zoning amendments in 1975 and 1981 effectively prohibited such asofright plazas along Sixth Avenue by inaugurating new design standards including requirements for amenities and a City Planning Commission Chairpersons review process known as certification The day of massive plazas fronting office towers on Sixth Avenue was over and a new dawn of urban plazas arrivedThe PaineWebber urban plaza is a fine example of the new approach To begin with the space is not even located in front of the building which is barely set back from the west side of Sixth Avenue Instead the buildings south and north sides extending west from Sixth Avenue along West 51st and 52nd Streets are recessed to accommodate mirrorimage rectangular plaza areas totaling slightly less than 10000 square feet Sculptor Scott Burton created two works for these areas conveniently entitled Urban Plaza South and Urban Plaza North 198586 In the south plaza area he installed three rows of fixed granite tables surrounded by three granite stools each that sprawl under the edge of the adjacent arcade In form and layout they suggest an archaeological find as if some ancient religious order rather than public art virtuoso had dictated their design and placement Two large triangular granite planters with bushes and builtin benches interpose a transitional zone between Sixth Avenue and the stone seats and tables In the north plaza area a reverse of the layout is attempted with a series of angular polished granite benches closer to Sixth Avenue and triangular planters located at backAn outdoor partially skylit through block galleria connects West 51st and 52nd Streets midblock between Sixth and Seventh Avenues at the back of the building With its sculptures wall murals of geometric patterns water pool and polished granite ledge seating and benches the space serves destination as well as circulation ends something expressly contemplated by the zoning standards for through block gallerias in contrast to the solitary circulation focus of through block connections The amusing bronze sculptures created by Barry Flanagan at each end are entitled Hare on Bell 1983 and Young Elephant 1984 and an elegant glassandgoldcolored structure houses escalators that lead to the concourse level of the Rockefeller Center complex and the subwayAs the inaugural link in the Citys longest most successful midblock pedestrian network a sixblock chain linking West 51st to 57th Streets the space makes its mark People love secret passageways those alternative ways to get from point A to point B often discovered by happenstance From a design perspective this type of midblock passageway finds its conceptual origins in the elaborate shopping arcades of eighteenth and nineteenth century European cities Covered shopping arcades appeared in Paris at the end of the eighteenth century as alternatives to the chaotic and before Baron Haussmanns midnineteenth century interventions cramped Parisian streets London introduced its own version of the shopping arcade in the nineteenth century culminating in a number of graceful soaring confections of glass iron and terracottaAs a matter of zoning policy the Citys ambition would be less extravagant Simple midblock shortcuts would be bonused or required especially in the Special Midtown Districts designated corridor between Sixth and Seventh Avenues as a means of easing the pedestrians burden along the lengthy avenuetoavenue span and as a means of reducing sidewalk congestion Knowing the difficulty of creating financially sustainable interior retail spaces retail frontage would not necessarily be mandated especially when no zoning bonus was granted Fully indoor spaces would not necessarily be preferred when covered outdoor corridors would perform adequatelyThis space links West 51st Street to the through block galleria at Flatotel connecting West 52nd and 53rd Streets the through block galleria at 1325 Avenue of the Americas between West 53rd and 54th Streets the through block connection at Rihga Royal Hotel between West 54th and 55th Streets the through block connection at CitySpire between West 55th and 56th Streets and principally but not exclusively the through block connection at Metropolitan Tower As discussed in the profile of the through block connection at Metropolitan Tower there are two other choices for reaching West 57th Street from West 56th Street without setting foot on or straying outside the boundaries of Sixth or Seventh Avenues including the through block arcade at Le Parker Meridian Hotel and the through block connection at Carnegie Hall TowerThere are five other midblock pedestrian networks fabricated from privately owned public spaces in the city A fourblock chain connects West 44th Street to 48th Streets and is described in the profile for Millennium Broadway The others are each two blocks long connecting East 48th to 50th Streets between Madison and Fifth Avenue as described in the profile of Tower 49 connecting East 51st and 53rd Streets between Madison and Fifth Avenues as described in the profile of Olympic Tower connecting East 55th to 57th Streets between Madison and Fifth Avenues as described in the profile of Sony and connecting West 44th to 46th between Broadway and Eighth Avenues as described in the profile of One Astor PlaceThe City has also encouraged the creation of subterranean and abovestreetlevel pedestrian networks For example a number of office buildings for example Paramount Plaza have received floor area bonuses to provide streetlevel access and belowground concourses linking to the subway system Downtown efforts such as the recently repealed Special Greenwich Street Development District south of the World Trade Center and its secondlevel pedestrian bridges have met with mixed results as described in the profile of One Bankers Trust PlazaThe through block galleria here marks the physical dividing line between the PaineWebber building and the Equitable Center Designed by different architects  Skidmore Owings  Merrill designed PaineWebber Edward Larrabee Barnes designed Equitable  and developed separately in two phases the buildings together offer an incredible array of art in their indoor privately owned lobbies that are nonetheless voluntarily opened to public visitation In the monumental lobby of the Equitable Center for example is Thomas Hart Bentons America Today 1930 a tenpanel Works Progress Administration tempera on linen that depicts American life and social conditions of the 1920s A huge Roy Lichtenstein work entitled Mural with Blue Brushstroke 198485 was commissioned for this space The PaineWebber Gallery has its own rotating collection of compelling artworks The sidewalk widening pedestrian circulation space along much of West 51st and 52nd Streets extending to Seventh Avenue completes the public space here,

Avenue,3.47,POPS,10022,Since the building once known as the IBM building was formally dedicated on October 4 1983 its glassenclosed covered pedestrian space has garnered near universal recognition as New York Citys peerless privately owned public space a treefilled conservatory and public living room rolled into one Like many storied urban places it has generated its share of amusing anecdotes and intriguing characters In the late 1980s after trying out a number of midtown indoor public spaces as rentfree offices for their budding dress company two enterprising New Yorkers selected the IBM space And for years a redsweatered woman devotedly occupied a small spot and assiduously typed away on her manual typewriter Along with the countless others who have enjoyed eating conversing reading and resting here the presence of these users has epitomized the ideal of an inclusive noncommercial privately owned public space in the heart of the cityPerhaps it is this deeply felt affection indeed sense of public ownership that explains why a proposal put forward several years ago by the buildings new owner to remove some of the emblematic 45foothigh bamboo tree stands and install in their stead a sculpture exhibition area with vaguely private commercial overtones  art for trees  was greeted with some dismay When the Minskoff ownership group purchased the IBM building in 1994 and applied to the City Planning Commission one year later for permission to modify the space alarm bells sounded Here was someone about to tamper with sacrosanct public space something that could be tolerated only if it were conclusively demonstrated that the changes would improve existing conditionsThe owner originally proposed to reduce from 11 to 5 the number of bamboo tree stands and remove the low dish planters to make physical and visual way for the indoor sculpture garden displaying largescale artworks by major artists of the twentieth century rotated regularly under the direction of the Pace Wildenstein Gallery The owner also proposed to increase the amount of seating albeit with benches substituting for some of the movable chairs to decrease the number of movable tables and to relocate the food kiosk from southwest to southeast corners making it more visible from Madison Avenue After hearing arguments for and against the changes and after the owner agreed to retain 8 of 11 bamboo stands install additional movable chairs without benches and keep the tables the City Planning Commission gave its approvalPublic response has generally tracked originally expressed opinions for and against the modification Although some observers are disappointed with the results others are gratified that the space has retained some of its most salient qualities and introduced a new one The 65foothigh triangular glasscovered atrium remains an aesthetically dramatic yet peaceful room Supported by a structure of crisscrossing white metal tubing the serrated glass roof and glass walls framing East 56th Street and part of Madison Avenue permit streams of sunlight to splash the bamboo trees and wash the white granite floor At times the light is so intense that it gives the space a faded look especially during the summer months although the looming host tower to the northeast and the Sony tower south across the street anchor the user in the very real very dense midtown ManhattanWhile Wordsworths brotherhood of venerable trees has been diminished and the planters once filled with brightly colored azaleas lilies and tulips that changed with the seasons are sadly absent sculptures by such artists as Henry Moore Karel Appel and Alexander Calder have taken their place Together with Levitated Mass 1982 environmental artist Michael Heizers sculpture in the urban plaza at the northwest corner of East 56th Street and Madison Avenue consisting of an 11ton stone incised with a coded building address and resting in a stainless steel basin of rushing water and the classic red steel Calder under the arcade overhang at the southwest corner of East 57th Street and Madison the public spaces here have become something of a public art magnetAnd significantly the space continues to rank high on usability Numerous movable silvercolored chairs and granitetopped tables are scattered about the seating area a space physically indistinguishable from the covered pedestrian space as people form their social patterns of individual and collective activity The food kiosk serves light lunch snacks and beverages and hopefully will keep the volume of its music turned down Even when the lack of air conditioning during the summer combines with the bamboo trees to foster a semitropical environment the space is never too uncomfortable and air conditioning is just steps away at the Trump Tower and Sony covered pedestrian spacesThe covered pedestrian space and seating area may be entered from both East 56th and 57th Streets between Madison and Fifth Avenues via a through block arcade that is open along its eastern side to the spaces from the northwest corner of East 56th Street and Madison Avenue via the urban plaza and through a passageway from Trump Tower and Niketown from the west Together with Sonys throughblock covered pedestrian space across East 56th Street the through block arcade creates one of the Citys six midblock pedestrian networks Together with the passageway connecting to Niketown and Trump Towers covered pedestrian space it is possible to reach Fifth Avenue Indeed the combination of 590 Madison Avenue and Trump Tower creates the Citys only complex of indoor connected privately owned public spaces uninterrupted by a street and provides an instructive contrast between a covered pedestrian space largely defined by commercial and one defined by largely noncommercial qualitiesSeveral other changes have occurred over the years The IBM Gallery of Science and Art that once hosted such exhibits as American Paintings from the Toledo Museum of Art and Manet to Matisse The Maurice Wertheim Collection has been replaced by the Newseum a media museum funded by the Freedom Forum The New York Botanical Gardens branch store is closed The space has a new name 590 Atrium but in the hearts and minds of its loyal users it will continue to be known as the IBM space,

Street,3,POPS,10004,Like many of its neighboring office towers the Goldman Sachs building was developed in around and over a historically significant part of the city The tower is adjacent to two historic districts designated by the Citys Landmarks Preservation Commission East is the Stone Street Historic District designated in recognition of its 17th and 18thcentury Dutch colonial street pattern of New Amsterdam and treasure trove of stylistically representative 19th and early 20thcentury smallscale merchant and commercial buildings erected after a devastating fire in December 1835 South across Pearl Street is the Fraunces Tavern Block Historic District and its early 19thcentury lowrise structures that survived the fireWhen landmark buildings are threatened by new development public policy solutions have ranged from requiring the complete preservation of the building to grafting building elements most notably the historic façade onto the new structure Solutions involving lessthanfull historic preservation inevitably raise controversy To some such solutions represent faux historic preservation and are rejected outofhand To others such solutions reflect the pragmatic outcome of complex balances that are necessarily struck between preservation interests and other economic and social interests in the highstakes cauldron of urban development politics and the physical evolution of cities With its Villard Houses courtyard the New York Palace Hotel at 457 Madison Avenue is a good example of this debateHere the historic issues principally involved streetand belowstreet level conditions rather than existing buildings and the public spaces became a major avenue for addressing them To begin with the new building was built directly on a portion of Stone Street whose historic lineage dates back to the 17thcentury period of Dutch settlement To enable the towers construction the City demapped and closed Stone Street between Broad Street and Coenties Alley but required that the alignment of the new buildings lobby follow the Stone Street alignment and be a publicly accessible lobby through which the public could walk as if on Stone Street from Broad Street to Coenties Alley after which the real Stone Street continues to the east A 1980 press release announcing the buildings development described the lobby path as the Spirit of Stone StreetOwing to security concerns expressed by Goldman Sachs in the summer of 1999 the Department of City Planning agreed to the owners installation of turnstiles inside the building at both ends of the lobby corridor Members of the public wishing to enter and pass through the lobby must now approach the security desk where an attendant will immediately activate the turnstile to permit public passage In addition the building must post three signs one at each entrance to the building stating that the public is welcome to follow the route of Stone Street and a third installed by Heritage Trails New York in the adjacent urban plaza describing the historic significance and configuration of Stone StreetThe public spaces here adopt another convention for recognizing the past special paving patterns plaques and exhibits that depict and explain the historic significance of the site For example the paving pattern of the sidewalk widening along Broad Street beckons the pedestrian to the building entrance where a bronzecolored map derived from a 1660 drawing is set into the sidewalk surface Along with brown paving stones the map shows the original alignment of Stone Street then called Hoog Straat leading directly through the buildings lobby as well as the location of other Dutch city landmarks including Fort Amsterdam the Bowling Green and Marketfield StreetOther plaques and exhibits in and out of the urban plaza and arcade next to Pearl Street describe how one of the citys largestever archaeological excavations was conducted onsite with 30 archaeologists from 1979 to 1980 how it uncovered wells privies and cisterns from the backyards of early Dutch houses and how it located the foundation of a 17thcentury Dutch tavern that became New Yorks first city hall Embedded transparent horizontal display covers reveal some of the archaeological material unearthed during this project including an 18thcentury cistern complete with household refuse and the taverns foundation walls Gray paving stones outline the approximate location of the rest of the taverns walls while creamcolored paving indicates the ground covered by the structureThe linear throughblock urban plaza east of the building provides a functional space for relaxing and eating food purchased from neighboring cafés and stores on adjacent Coenties Alley Two rows of 20 planters with trees march up and down the space A long granite ledge near the trees and three wooden benches at the Pearl Street tip furnish seating The space parallel to Pearl Street going to Broad Street looks public and provides seating even if legally it is not required to be publicFinally the building incorporates a rare arcade typology one that circumnavigates the entire base Rimmed by rough granite columns this spacious passageway is lit by hanging white and gold globes that conceptually reinforce the circumnavigation theme while subtly referencing the new global economy promoted by financial firms such as Goldman Sachs More sidewalk widening borders South William Street,

space at Trump Tower is simultaneously New York Citys most famous and least understood privately owned public space Most famous because everyone has heard of it Least understood because few New Yorkers appreciate that this space is legally required to be open and accessible to the public The developer Donald Trump obtained zoning floor area bonuses in return for the covered pedestrian space and two outdoor landscaped terraces on upper floors as well as for additional retail space In short this unabashed unapologetic and by any crowd measure popular celebration of commerce is a product of public as well as private entrepreneurial espritA sign near the entrance declares Welcome to the worlds most extraordinary shopping experience And indeed hyperbole is the order of the day The interior at Trump Tower is eye candy a confection of colors layers reflections movements and glitz A doorman in uniform like that of a royal guard ushers visitors through the monumental brassglassfaçade of the Fifth Avenue entrance Red pink orange and beigeswirled marble walls and floors merge to overtake the senses In gravitys thrall visitors are pulled by the corridors downward slope past retail stores and two large goldcolored Ts to the centerpiece a sixstory skylit shopping atrium Physically encircled by overhanging balcony corridors multistory water wall and five sets of switchback escalators the atrium strenuously engages visual and aural senses Reflections and sounds bounce off the profusion of marble brass glass and mirrored surfaces People stream up and down the escalators sometimes to the point of overcrowding then peer out over shiny railings rimming the precipitous edges of the shopping floors While many of the stores seem geared to a predominantly tourist clientele the shopping ambiance even if vicarious is almost overpoweringThe covered pedestrian spaces legally required floor area occurs at both street and belowstreet concourse levels At street level in the entrance corridor across from the elevators is the first recognizable public amenity a long marble bench where people plant themselves bags askew to gain strength for further Fifth Avenue shopping or simply to relax The bench has an interesting past In 1984 an enthusiast of the space wrote a letter to Mr Trump and the Citys Department of Buildings with a copy to then Mayor Edward Koch complaining that management had placed plants and flowers on the bench thereby obstructing sitting The plants and flowers were subsequently removedAt concourse level at the base of the atrium are numerous movable tables and chairs tightly packed on a slightly elevated platform next to the water wall In the past nearby food outlets have indulged in episodes of café creep spilling out into the covered pedestrian space It is important to recognize that members of the public may sit at any of these tables and chairs without obligation to purchase anything Public restrooms are located at the end of a corridor leading from the southwest corner of the spaceThe two outdoor landscaped terraces on upper levels require a degree of perseverance to find especially because signage on the street floor where most of the public initially gathers is meager Reachable by one of the elevators off the Fifth Avenue entrance corridor or by escalators the fourth floor terrace at the southeast corner of the atrium is a petite garden space with trees planters comfortable polished granite ledge seating and birdseye views of the iconic postmodern Sony building designed by Philip Johnson to the east and Fifth Avenue to the west The recently renovated and more ambitious landscaped terrace on the north side of the fifth floor is currently less used than its fourth floor counterpart an irony in that the space is not only more capacious and better appointed but it is also more easily reached whether by escalator by Trump elevator off the Fifth Avenue entrance corridor by Niketown elevator from street level near the northeast corner of the covered pedestrian space or from the top floor of Niketown itself Signs at and within the multiple entries unfortunately tend to confuse referring to the Public Garden the Roof Terrace a location on the fifth floor and a location on the sixth floor In fact the landscaped terrace is on Trumps fifth floor and Niketowns sixth floorWhatever it is called the space is an extremely pleasant rectangular roof garden extending to a view of East 57th Street The street scene is visible though five huge picture windows crowned with four American flags loosely evoking the New York impressionist paintings of Childe Hassam A bluetinged pool with fountains is flanked by fixed metal benches on one side and nine large trees on the other Stylish movable silver tables and chairs are distributed throughout and nearest East 57th Street is an elevated sliver with additional tables and chairs and a secluded corner The only thing missing is the usersA passageway connects the Trump covered pedestrian space to the indoor spaces at 590 Madison Avenue to the east Although this marriage of spaces is the Citys only example of connected indoor public spaces uninterrupted by a street it is hardly a union of like personalities To the benefit of both the formers commercial exuberance is nicely counterbalanced by the latters tranquillity A third covered pedestrian space at the Sony building across East 56th Street from 590 Madison Avenue makes this area a highdensity showcase for indoor public spaces,

quartercentury life the Olympic Tower throughblock covered pedestrian space linking East 51st and 52nd Streets has faced the awesome challenge of competing for public space users with one of the worlds greatest shopping streets Fifth Avenue Why should anyone go to this space when Fifth Avenue runs parallel some 50 feet to the west and the spaces existence is not even evident to the average Fifth Avenue pedestrian If the space were to succeed as a destination it would have to offer more than simple protection from the elements Although it contributed to the creation of a parallel pedestrian circulation system along with the HarperCollins through block arcade to the north connecting East 51st to 53rd Streets the closeness of Fifth Avenue would decrease the shortcut appeal The spaces longstanding history of scant public use restaurant closings and absent retail tenants only underscores the difficulty of the competition At a recent site visit the space was under renovation suggesting that its owner is still trying to discover the right design including amenities and other uses that would make it a successEntered from East 51st Street across from St Patricks Cathedral or from East 52nd Street across from the southern end of the HarperCollins through block arcade the space observes the twozone design convention of several enclosed throughblock covered pedestrian spaces dedicating part of the space to circulation and part to destination functions Here the western portion is dedicated to movement and access to the elevators for the commercial space in Olympic Tower Without retail stores or seating along this western side there is no reason to linger stop or change directionThe eastern portion lying out of circulations way accommodates the functional amenities although the proposed renovation may change this arrangement Closest to East 51st Street is a small area that has yet to find its identity Previously used for restaurant seating general seating and an adjacent newstand it has been subject to renovation efforts several times before Toward the middle are the restrooms and in the past a café Tables and chairs arrayed on two tiers descending northward overlook a granitebacked waterfall and basementlevel pool When the waterfall is in operation a mirror creates the illusion of more water A vacant glassenclosed room at pool level visible but inaccessible from above is all that remains of unsuccessful restaurant efforts Close to East 52nd Street was the only tiny retail location that had operated consistently although it appears to be closedThe presence of a parallel throughblock covered pedestrian space so close to Fifth Avenue raises an interesting urban planning question What is wrong with walking and shopping on Fifth Avenue That the City at one time allowed even encouraged the creation of an alternative circulation network and offthestreet spaces that would draw pedestrians and shoppers away from retailers on Fifth Avenue may seem strange today In the early 1970s however city planners were worried that the Fifth Avenue public sidewalks were becoming so crowded that the experience of shopping and promenading was being compromised They were also concerned that passive uses such as travel agencies and bank branches were squeezing out active retail uses that made Fifth Avenue the success it wasTo address these issues the City adopted in 1971 the Special Fifth Avenue District a zoning district designed among other things to preserve protect and enhance the character of Fifth Avenue as the showcase of New York and national retail shopping and to encourage the concentration of major stores retail clustering restaurants and related activities which complement the special image and character of this unique area Midblock parallel pathways and interior spaces strategically deployed were seen as devices that could alleviate some of the sidewalk congestion for the greater good of the street The only

graniteenclosed multistory covered pedestrian space to a successful collaboration with the Whitney Museum of American Art Located at the southwest corner of Park Avenue and East 42nd Street across from Grand Central Terminal and open seven days a week the space has displayed sculptures from that museums permanent collection since it was completed in 1982 With the Whitney able to exhibit only a small percentage of its collection at any one time arrangements such as this can benefit spacehungry museums corporate patrons and members of the public alike Indeed such collaborative efforts are models for cultural institutions seeking new locations and audiences for their exhibits concert series dramatic presentations and similar artistic endeavors and for privately owned public space owners wondering how they may revitalize their spacesThe covered pedestrian space may be entered either from East 42nd Street or Park Avenue under an arcade wrapping around north and east sides of the building Unlike some designs this one unapologetically separates the private lobby entrance from the public space entrance locating the private entrance at the northwest corner of Park Avenue and East 41st Street The closest that public space users come to that lobby is via a view through windows on the western and southern walls of the space Despite this separation there is no evidence whatsoever that the space has been disowned by its host buildingThe Park Avenue entrance offers the most dramatic entrance placing the user on a terrace seven steps above the floor and providing a vantage point from which to survey the space the artworks and the functional amenities With its substantial height narrow width and gray granite columns the space could have conveyed an austere formality were it not for its use of generously sized windows on all four walls that cleverly expand the visual boundaries and allow in large amounts of natural daylight In combination with recessed ceiling lights the windows guarantee a light and airy atmosphere unusual for most indoor privately owned public spaces The artwork also humanizes the space Over the years sculptures have been scattered about in close proximity with users spawning an informal immediacy delightfully at variance with the customary formal museum setting Longtime visitors may recall George Segals buoyant bronze with white patina called Dancers of four nude women dancing together holding hands in homage to Matisses Dance Also installed was a painted chromeandmetal work entitled City Lux by John Chamberlain composed of crushed automobile parts Other standouts from the past have included Jonathan Borofskys Man with a Briefcase Deborah Butterfields horse sculptures and Roy Lichtensteins Three Brushstrokes A Frank Stella abstract painted metal relief endures on the western wallThe Whitney also operates a free special exhibition area to the west of the entrance at East 42nd Street with exhibits refreshed six times a year and gallery talks on Mondays Wednesdays and Fridays The sign that once banned food and beverages in this exhibit space now bans smoking as well a sign of the times even at the Philip Morris Building Other public spaces that endeavor to provide a critical mass of art include the covered plaza at Two Lincoln Square and the covered pedestrian space at 590 Madison Avenue An effort at tying a Whitney branch to another public space foundered years ago at Two Federal Reserve Plaza downtownEven without the art the space satisfies many preferences of public space users A food kiosk at the southwest corner provides refreshment Next door are the public restrooms not identified as such and requiring a security guard pass to enter Two nearby pianos are available for ongoing programs Numerous movable black tables and chairs cover the floor next to the kiosk and pianos supplemented by comfortable builtin benches to the east that are continuously occupied Closer to East 42nd Street and Park Avenue is a platform three steps up that is covered with movable tables and chairs nestled among several trees Still more builtin benches here and at the northeast corner offer nooks and crannies for usersOne additional fact about the Philip Morris building is worth noting When the City designated Grand Central Terminal a landmark in 1967 it also authorized the terminal owner to transfer otherwise unusable development rights to adjacent parcels The Philip Morris building was the first building to take advantage of this option purchasing 74655 square feet of development rights from the terminal owners for use here Recently 383 Madison Avenue became the second building to utilize some of Grand Central Terminals development rights,

Plaza: 16Trees within Space: Elevated Plaza: 25",,-74.009154,40.703183,55 Water Street,4,POPS,10004,Surrounded by Water Street the southwest side of Old Slip and South Street this building has two of the largest outdoor public spaces in the city and some of the best views of Brooklyn and the East River The plaza at street level is a long rectangular windswept sea of brick extending from Water Street to South Street along the southwest side of the building Near Water Street is a stairwell leading to a defunct belowground shopping mall A channel of water used to flow from the plaza toward and down the stairwellVisually the plaza looks much larger than its legally required size because it is seamlessly joined to the Cityowned triangular Vietnam Veterans Plaza formerly known as Jeanette Park to the southwest The owner of 55 Water Street was required by a City special permit to rebuild and maintain Jeanette Park and the privately owned and publicly owned public spaces appear to function as one spaceAgainst the foreground of the plazas open brick surface and just across the invisible border between privately owned and Cityowned space is the New York Vietnam Veterans Memorial an upright rectangular slab composed of translucent greenishglass blocks etched with the contents of poignant letters and other writings from American soldiers in Vietnam to their families and friends back in the United States The wall is pierced by two portals framed in granite that symbolically allow the viewer to enter however briefly the soldiers world before passing safely to the other side At night the monument is lit from within creating an eerie ghostlike sensation befitting the subject matter The memorial was a product of a design competition initiated in 1982 by a Cityestablished commission and the winning entry was conceived and completed by architects Peter Wormser and William Fellows and writer John Ferrandino in 1984 to 1985On the Vietnam Veterans Plaza side of the memorial is an amphitheater with stepped brick seating chiseled out of the grade change At the top of the brick steps are stubby blackmetal bollards strung with lights which create a necklace effect in the evening The remaining area southwest features round concrete benches that sprout like mushrooms under a forest of tall trees spreading their protective green canopyThree stories above Water Street the elevated plaza is one of only six substantially elevated outdoor spaces in the city The others are at One Bankers Trust Plaza Trump Tower Murray Hill Mews 622 Third Avenue and 300 East 59th Street Unlike the others it is the only elevated space expressly created under the Zoning Resolutions specific provision for elevated plazas Entry is from Water Street up the escalators or stairs or from South Street up a narrow stairwell In past years the space has been closed from time to time because among other things repairs to the escalators had to be made While repair renovation and construction projects may legitimately preclude public access for a limited period they cripple public use when such projects linger for months or even years or recur on an alltooregular basis In this case the City and owner have exchanged numerous letters in the past about lack of access most recently addressing the issue in 1997The space itself is interesting especially for the views it permits of the East River and Brooklyn with its skyline redolent of 19th and early 20thcentury New York To the northeast across Old Slip is a birdseye view of the building that is home to New York Citys Landmarks Preservation Commission The elevated plaza measures close to an acre divided between an empty flat brick surface and a curving raised terrace composed of planters water pools sittable ledges and wood benches Here are semiprivate and private areas protected from the wind that are particularly pleasant during hot summer daysIn the outdoor public space lexicon elevated and sunken are controversial qualifiers Such spaces especially the elevated ones can be remote inconvenient even scary removed from the familiarity and security of street eyes and ears They can also harm the vitality of the sidewalk itself by creating a lacuna in the adjacent ground plane At its inception the zoning definition of the asofright plaza precluded the elevated or sunken plaza requiring that all plazas be no more than five feet above or more than 12 feet below the curb level In part to accommodate this space the City in 1968 enacted a zoning amendment allowing elevated plazas following a discretionary review by the City Planning Commission The City approved this space in the hope that it would become one component in a secondlevel pedestrian circulation network extending east over the FDR Drive to the river Like the effort in the Special Greenwich Street Development District which attempted to create another secondlevel pedestrian circulation network on the other side of downtown this one never came to fruition The profile of public spaces at One Bankers Trust Plaza discusses the Special Greenwich Street Development District plan in more detailThe remaining public space at 55 Water Street includes an arcade that wraps around half of the Water Street side of the building and continues along the full southwest side Additional plaza area that is effectively more sidewalk may be found on Water Street between the entrance to the elevated plaza escalators and Old Slip,

space and its fourstory atrium at the southeast corner of Fifth Avenue and East 47th Street for the first time That is a common reaction among most firsttime users who stumble upon it and wonder why they had not known of it beforeThe space is a smaller less glitzy rendition of Trump Towers covered pedestrian space 10 blocks north with similar materials color palette and crisscrossing escalators But that is where the similarity ends While Trump Tower is a triumph of marketing making it one of the must see places along with the Empire State Building and the Statue of Liberty on a typical tourist itinerary 575 Fifth has yet to be discovered even by resident New Yorkers who would greatly value its quiet demeanor and uncrowded atmosphereThe modest entrances off the east side of Fifth Avenue or East 47th Street through arcade spaces hardly foreshadow the scene inside Down a short corridor from the Fifth Avenue entrance one unexpectedly encounters the part postmodern part art deco part streamlined moderne fourlevel atrium The streetlevel corridors surrounding the atrium core and the full concourse level below constitute the required square footage of the covered pedestrian space The public area includes the second floor corridors Polished redandwhiteswirled marble floors siennahued granite walls towering lacquered columns and brass trim aim to communicate luxury Reflections of light shimmer vibrantly on the high sheen surfaces and the floor is so slick that placards warn users of slippery conditions when shoes are wet from rain or snow The atrium is crowned by a 1600squarefoot stained glass ceiling by artist Hank Prussing composed of geometric patterns rendered in vivid blues purples yellows and browns An elaborate multilevel conveyance system connects level to level Parallel escalators arrayed eastwest link the Fifth Avenue side of the first floor to the second floor Escalators at the eastern side of the first floor track the same route but descend to the concourse level Escalators tying second and third floors pass each other in opposite directions along a northsouth alignment A tubeshapedglassandbrasstrimmed elevator reminiscent of John Portmaninfluenced hotel atria rises at the southeast corner and people enter it as much for the ride as for purposeful transportation Taken together these transport devices visually summon forth a tame version of Fritz Langs Metropolis and its pulsating systems of movementThe concourse level harbors a number of usable amenities A central court is framed by elegant marble planters filled with colorful flowers and plants Metal benches are nestled against the inside wall of the planters between six fourstory lacquered columns Pleasantsounding small fountains sparkling with uplights flank the escalators Surrounding the court is an outer corridor meant to be fronted by retail stores and a restaurant to the north The tables and chairs here appear to be used by the adjacent restaurant but should be available to members of the public without obligation to purchase anything Restrooms are located near the southeast corner of the outer corridor but were locked at a recent site visit Another public restroom is available off the southeast corner of the public area on the second floorWith all the accoutrements the retail promise of the space has yet to be realized According to marketing literature distributed by the building around the time it opened 15 years ago This 55000 square foot retail phenomenon will be surrounded in all directions by some of the most prestigious stores to be found anywhere The plan was for fashion apparel stores to occupy the second and third floors for small boutiques carrying fashion accessories to be on the first floor and for everything from a wine bar to a gourmet food shop to stores selling stationery luggage and home furnishings to line the concourse floor Although some national clothing retailers have rented space here the atrium has not yet achieved the goal set forth in its literature and storefronts especially at upper and concourse floors have suffered from vacanciesWhy has this atrium had a mixed record as a retail space Retail experts might spotlight the inherent difficulties associated with vertical retailing the store mix the design layout changing retail trends and the street location Urban planners and designers might question the validity of an internalized vertical specialty retail mall on one of the worlds greatest shopping streets Adopted in 1971 the Special Fifth Avenue District zoning encouraged such covered pedestrian spaces with floor area bonuses in the belief that the Fifth Avenue sidewalks were becoming too crowded for their own good and that more retail opportunities along the street would be helpful It was not necessarily endorsing or vouchsafing a market concept however In the end the weakness of retail activity might simply suggest that people prefer to shop at street level from sidewalks especially when that street is Fifth AvenueHow then should the success of Trump Tower itself a vertical mall be understood Trump was earlier bigger flashier blessed with a few marquee highend retailers and situated at a higher traffic location Its success may be measured in tourist crowds although such crowds do not always translate into hard retail dollars Indeed much of Trump Towers retail is of greater interest to tourists than to New Yorkers For the public space user however the relative underuse of 575 Fifth Avenue augments its allure Huge retail success here might

tree, Open Air Concourse: 6",,-73.970037,40.758398,153 East 53 Street,4,POPS,10022,When completed in 1975 the Citicorp building as it was then named garnered initial attention for its silvery aluminumclad tower poised for takeoff on four 10story stilts and topped with a rakish slanted roof But its interior design quickly gained an independent reputation among members of the public and public space specialists Although the building exhibited four different kinds of privately owned public space  a plaza open air concourse through block arcade and covered pedestrian space  it was the covered pedestrian space and its sevenstory atrium that became the featured attractionThe development occupies almost the entire block bounded by Lexington and Third Avenues and East 53rd and 54th Streets excluding a small area at the corner of East 53rd Street and Third Avenue In its middle is the 7247squarefoot covered pedestrian space on the buildings concourse level below the street There are six access points from the surrounding streets including two entrances to the through block arcade and down the escalator from either East 53rd or 54th Streets between Third and Lexington Avenues another entrance on East 53rd Street closer to Lexington Avenue an entrance from the plaza down steps into and through the open air concourse from the northeast corner of East 53rd Street and Lexington Avenue an entrance from the Lexington Avenue plaza closer to East 54th Street through exterior and interior corridors and down an escalator and an entrance down steps from the southwest corner of East 54th Street and Third Avenue and through a private restaurant This last path is confusing even treacherous as users must navigate past waiters patrons and crowded tables along a trail that is not always expressly delineated Still compared with most indoor spaces containing belowground levels this one is unusually accessible from the street and such permeability is an important element in enticing pedestrians to visit otherwise offthepath belowground interiorsOnce there the full scope of the cavernous atrium is revealed rising seven stories and cresting in three glass Aframe skylights The covered pedestrian space level is ringed by circulation corridors and storefronts at concourse and street levels while the upper levels consist of glass picture windows interspersed with bands of polished aluminum Public space users from below watch the office tenants above as much or more than the office occupants peer downThe space features a cornucopia of usable amenities Numerous movable round and square tables and chairs are packed onto the polished granite floor The kiosk and surrounding stores furnish food for a crowd that especially at lunchtime can be so large that people sometimes must wait for tables and chairs Thankfully even at noon when crowds begin to gather the space is never too noisy or chaotic Its size absorbs sound while its muted lighting scheme and natural sunlight intermittently filtering through the skylight calm the visual scene The recent addition of muzak will hopefully be shortlived The requirement that there be one use or sales area for every 25 feet of frontage on the East 53rd Street side of the space is meant to encourage a diversity of casual restaurants and takeout facilities that in the past has worked so well here The womens restroom is located underneath the East 54th Street through block arcade entry the mens under the East 53rd Street entrySince its opening 25 years ago this covered pedestrian space has displayed a mix of identities molded by private and public aspirations For a time it sought status as a shopping mall advertising itself through snazzy marketing plaques as the Market in the Atrium where The Skys the Limit Boogie Woogie Rock n Roll And All that Jazz Little Bit of Broadway And Lots of Razzmatazz Its Magical A Festival A Carnival Day and Night A Pure Delight Come on in the Atrium For Fun For Free The Place to Be Market realities and strategic repositioning eventually altered this approach replacing it with more modest retail goalsIn the late 1980s and early 1990s the space was heavily used on weekends by immigrants from Hungary Czechoslovakia when it still was Czechoslovakia and other Eastern European countries They would come in weekly from Forest Hills and other city neighborhoods for a rendezvous and snack with friends That Citicorp the quintessential representative of capitalism should provide space for a reconstituted community of Iron Curtain country refugees was an amusement commented upon by several of the regulars The space to this day serves as venue for special occasions One group of cousins arranges a yearly gettogether as their spokesperson describes We come from Brooklyn This is a great meeting place We have the restaurants here and we have a favorite    and then we come back here and have our dessert and coffee and talk a little longer and we show pictures of our children wedding pictures children and whatever I like seeing people of all ages too I like to study them There are all kinds that make up the world and you can see some that are very lonely others studying The space appears to be best understood as a hybrid neither fully dedicated to retail like Trump Tower nor fully devoid of retail like 590 Madison Avenue It gains much of its identity from its diverse changing set of users like neighborhoods throughout the cityThe covered pedestrian space is one of two indoor spaces here Entered down several steps from the public sidewalk the through block arcade bisects the building east and one level above the covered pedestrian space floor connecting East 53rd and 54th Streets The level change from the sidewalk tends to hide the through block arcade from sidewalk pedestrians discouraging pedestrians from using a shortcut that requires marching down and up steps The two outdoor spaces are best understood from a standing start at the northeast corner of Lexington Avenue and East 53rd Street At street level is the plaza a small sliver of extra sidewalk along the avenue that features a wellutilized seating ledge and three flagpoles It would be interesting for flagpoles a common obstruction in public spaces to fly specially designed public space flags along with more traditional ones The plaza sliver closest to East 54th Street fronts the geometrically challenging St Peters Church known for its jazz vespers organ recitals and Louise Nevelson sculptures A window on East 54th Street allows the pedestrian to watch the congregationLike 55 Water Street with its elevated plaza Citigroup Center is one of a small group of catalyst buildings whose proposed development literally inspired the legal introduction of a new category of bonused public space the open air concourse to the Zoning Resolution The twolevel sunken open air concourse is entered down 24 steps from the corner of Lexington Avenue and East 53rd Street Water cascades along the face of a primitive monolithic structure next to the steps reaching its aural crescendo at the bottom Softened by several trees growing out of the pavement the upper level of the open air concourse is dedicated to circulation into the building interior and the covered pedestrian space to the east and into the subway station to the southeast A lower level north and down another eight steps supplies metal tables and seats The views from here are stimulating Above and east is the underbelly of the cantilevered tower whose awesome mass and engineering convey the feeling one might have at the base of a rocket Another view of the church interior is available to the north,

52nd and 53rd Streets An open space occupies the triangular area at the southeast corner of Third Avenue and East 53rd Street A public circulation space inside the building connects users from the open space to the threelevel covered pedestrian space Miniscule arcade spaces cover the entrances to the covered pedestrian space at the northeast corner of Third Avenue and East 52nd Street and on East 53rd Street east of Third AvenueOf the four the covered pedestrian space is the main attraction In some respects it is similar to the space at the Crystal Pavilion building two blocks south It operates on three levels including ground concourse and mezzanine levels It has a threestory open core that is partially enclosed by glass skylight to the northwest Its ground level serves mostly as a circulation corridor creating a shortcut from the northeast corner of Third Avenue and East 52nd Street northeast to East 53rd Street while providing access in the middle via crisscrossing bright redpaneled escalators to concourse and mezzanine levels At the concourse level eight types of food outlets purvey their wares to large lunchtime crowds seated at the plentiful movable tables and chairs A flower shop adds color and a piano stands at the ready The mezzanine level above surrounds the core and furnishes more tables and chairsThere are a number of differences however between this space and the one at Crystal Pavilion that hold important lessons for the planning and design of covered pedestrian spaces Although this one lacks Crystal Pavilions surface sizzle  indeed the redandblack color scheme seems plain by comparison  it nonetheless hosts a level of activity unseen down the street The explanations are easy to unearth To begin with this covered pedestrian space is not an end in itself Its street level is activated by the stream of employees and visitors who pass through the space to reach the private elevators of the office tower The concourse level provides access to the subway an attraction especially important for sunken spaces whether inside or outside that inevitably need something extra to generate the foot traffic Once there if there is something else to interest passersby such as food they will stop creating more activity that itself draws othersAnother difference between this covered pedestrian space and the one at Crystal Pavilion is its street face Here the interior space is not cloaked behind a typical office building entry façade that does everything but tell passersby about the existence of something interesting inside The open space at Third Avenue and East 53rd Street was created in 1990 after several existing lowrise buildings were demolished in a second development phase By removing these structures the design initiated a salutary transparency between outdoor and indoor public experiences influencing pedestrians to pause for a moment at the movable tables and chairs in front of the café or to enter the interior space visually evident through the glass wallSeveral other amenities are worth citing The streetlevel covered pedestrian space and public circulation space have tables chairs and adjacent food service and it is important to note that members of the public may sit without obligation to purchase anything The café does have its own seating area however northeast of the public circulation space that it may operate as it chooses Weekly public events at least one hour in length are scheduled Two public restrooms are located at the eastern end of the concourse level behind dark glass doors that the guard must open At least two guards patrol the spacesThe operation of these spaces today stands in contrast to a bumpy early history In 1983 the City brought a court action against the building owner when it leased out two office floors representing the bonus floor area for the spaces prior to completing the spaces as described in the special permit and restrictive declaration The City and owner were able to settle the dispute,

HarperCollins through block arcade distinguishes itself as much for what it connects as for what it is Facing the arcade across East 53rd Street is Paley Park one of the citys treasured privately owned private spaces open to the public through the goodwill of its owner South across East 52nd Street is the entrance to Olympic Towers throughblock covered pedestrian space Together the HarperCollins and Olympic Tower public spaces forge a twoblock protected passageway making possible a direct pilgrimage between Saint Patricks Cathedral and Paley ParkAs for the through block arcade itself it serves its purpose of pedestrian connection well At East 53rd Street a black cylindrical totem announces a beginning or terminus Unenclosed at both ends the twostory corridor is designed for movement with capacious width few retail distractions and no obstructions Like milestones black rectangular columns on white stone walls rhythmically mark the journeys progress Long rows of theatrical lighting above gently guide users north or south and generate necessary illumination Small plaza spaces occupy the buildings setbacks at both East 52nd and 53rd Street entrances and provide planters with evergreen bushes and on East 52nd Street a sittable ledgeBecause Paley Park is not a legally required privately owned public space as that term is used in this book it lacks its own profile Its proximity to the HarperCollins space however provides a geographical hook if not a convenient excuse to remedy that exclusion Designed by the noted landscape architectural firm of Zion  Breen and named for Samuel Paley by his son the CBS executive William Paley who created the space Paley Park opened on May 23 1967 and has since become a model for how philanthropy and design can produce a peerless public spaceThe 4200squarefoot park roughly 42 feet by 100 feet eases its rectangular geometry through a sublime blend of natural and synthetic materials textures colors and sounds The park notifies passersby of its presence through strategic placement of trees planters filled with brightly colored flowers and special paving on the sidewalk Up four steps through a narrowed entrance is ordered nature a modernist landscape As a standalone space unconnected to a bonused building and the stream of workers or residents in and outa vestpocket park without the suit the space can focus on its singular mission of serenity contemplation and renewalThe ground is paved not with terrazzo or concrete but with roughhewn stone tiles The 17 trees spaced at 12foot intervals grow out of the surface and are tall enough that their understory sustains an open air feeling while their canopies block out looming skyscrapers Planters overflow with flowers Ivycovered brownbrick walls protectively envelop the space and exclude winds that bedevil so many plazas Scattered generously throughout are movable Bertoia wiremesh chairs Bird Chair by Harry Bertoia 19501952 and movable tables A food kiosk at the southeast corner gatehouse sells light refreshment while the gatehouse at the southwest corner shelters mechanical equipment for park maintenance activitiesAt back is the wondrous and accessible rockfaced 20foot waterfall If Paley Parks visual cues have not removed the intensity of the city then the whooshing water noise and spray will complete the job Water does not trickle down it pours down hits a level and then pours down some more into a pool According to the park superintendent a 50horsepower pump pushes a recirculated 1800 gallons per minute uphill for its downward journey Only in January is the waterfall drained and turned off Otherwise on cold days the water is heated by a steam turbine before it is pumpedPaley Parks quality is confirmed by its unusual quantity and mix of users In addition to the regulars who work or live nearby are the accidental or intentional tourists On any given day the roster might include random visitors from New Jersey or Japan as well as landscape architects and designers making the educational journey At last check the space maintained hours from 800 am to 1000 pm May 1 through November 1 and from 800 am to 800 pm November 2 through April 30Is there a lesson here The subtext of the plaque near the entrance subtly implies one This park is set aside in memory of Samuel Paley 18751963 for the enjoyment of the public No sign announces that the space is required by law to be open to the public No zoning design standards were mandated and no zoning bonus was given Like the outdoor spaces at Rockefeller Center the 6360squarefoot Greenacre Park on the north side of East 51st Street between Second and Third Avenues or the Ford Foundation building atrium on the north side of East 42nd Street between First and Second Avenues Paley Park is a product of a private owners sense of civic philanthropy interest in urban design and understanding of wise stewardship Paley took highvalue land that would normally accommodate a revenueearning building and made way for a park He hired a top landscape architect Robert Zion who had for years promoted the idea of parklets substantially smaller than the City Parks Departments then prevailing notion that three acres was the minimum acceptable park size to design the space He and his wife created and funded the position of a fulltime park superintendent and associated maintenance personnel According to one of the recent superintendents the two visited the space regularly and Mrs Paleys morning stop included instructions about which flowers to plant each month In short zoning incentives and legal requirements are helpful but not always sufficient for the task of creating excellence in public spacesPaley Parks influence extends well beyond its borders In New York City and elsewhere around the country many urban outdoor spaces borrow design features from the park Some New York spaces have substantially modeled themselves on Paley Park including for example the nearby spaces at 520 Madison Avenue and 535 Madison Avenue and the park at One East River Place,

throughout this elegant through block arcade connecting West 56th and 57th Streets between Sixth and Seventh Avenues While some buildings disown their public space by segregating it geographically and administratively from the private entrances and activities this private hotel by design and management has so masterfully integrated the though block arcade into its own functional orbit that it is difficult to tell where private ends and public begins Like a tuning fork the basic layout includes two legs from West 56th Street converging midblock at a threestory atrium and a single corridor stretching north from the atrium to West 57th Street The blurring of private and public is especially pronounced in the western leg entered from West 56th Street past a strip of plaza Here the through block arcade literally doubles as the hotel lobby complete with checkin desk and support services It would be impossible for any member of the public to discern that this is part of the public space without being told as here that it is At least the doorway to the eastern leg off West 56th Street is identified on its glass window as an entrance to public spaceInside here is a richly trimmed twostory corridor featuring polished patterned marble floor and walls of pastel pink and beige columns arches and mirrors Seating that appears disappears and reappears in this corridor has led to a series of legal disputes between the City and building owner The 1979 special permit requiring the through block arcade also mandated 54 movable chairs and 18 movable tables allocated to this corridor and the midblock atrium by plans approved as part of the special permit action In 1991 following reported thefts from hotel guests that the owner attributed to perpetrators using the chairs the owner applied to the City Planning Commission to reduce the amount and change the configuration of required seating Although the application was never completed the owner nonetheless removed the chairsVisitors to the space who enjoyed the chairs including dancers from the Joffrey Ballet who rehearsed nearby were unhappy On October 13 1992 the Citys Department of Buildings issued a notice of violation for failure to maintain the movable chairs in this part of the through block arcade An administrative law judge dismissed the notice on January 21 1993 finding that the chairs were not a point of emphasis in the original 1979 special permit and that the chairs did not serve what he understood as the essential purpose of substantially improved pedestrian circulation On appeal the Citys Environmental Control Board reversed concluding that the chairs did indeed provide an important amenity and that there was no proof that seating was an insignificant part of the conditions set forth in the special permit The owner was fined 475 for its violation of the Zoning Resolution The owner next brought its own action in a New York state trial court claiming that the decision of the Environmental Control Board was arbitrary and capricious and requesting that the decision be annulled On October 7 1994 the state court judge dismissed the owners petition and upheld the Boards determinationThe legal saga did not end there however Shortly after the judges decision the Buildings Department filed another notice of violation for failure to provide required chairs and tables This time an administrative law judge on April 11 1995 concluded that the apparently reduced number of movable chairs benches and a desk present at the time of the latest Buildings Department inspection were in substantial compliance with the original 1979 special permitThe owner has recently stated that the chairs have been replaced with eight benches accommodating twotothree people each and twelve additional chairs five tables and a desk Recent site visits have confirmed this arrangement showing blond wood benches in the eastern corridor and additional large chairs and tables in the atrium That adds up to at most 36 places to sit and five tables short of the originally mandated 54 chairs and 18 tables Additional discussions between the City and owner will be forthcomingIn the middle of the arcade is the multistory skylit rectangular atrium surrounded by an upperlevel loggia The atrium appears to serve principally as a gathering space for hotel and restaurant guests and a crossing lane from the lobby to the private restrooms The northern portion of through block arcade continues the postmodern design motif with decorative ceiling Without seats and retail frontage however the corridor is quiet serving strictly as a passageway to and from West 57th Street Passersby on West 57th Street would have a hard time knowing that this is a public space The multistory façade is a compressed mixture of columns pilasters and pediment presented in pastel shades of pink and beige that simply looks like a private entrance Le Parker Meridien Hotels through block arcade is one of three choices although not the most convenient one for completing the sixblock run of midblock spaces from West 51st Street For a further discussion of this profusion of choice see the

Building designed by Philip Johnson and John Burgee first enrolled in Manhattans skyline in 1983 most of the attention focused on its splitpediment Chippendale top and its postmodern iconic meaning Roughly ten years later however when ownership of the building shifted from ATT to the Sony Corporation the focus shifted downward That is because in 1992 Sony applied to the City Planning Commission for permission to pack Sony retail store space into most of the 60foottall openair arcade encircling the building on the west side of Madison Avenue and on East 55th and 56th Streets The proposal bluntly raised the question when if ever privatization of public space should be formally allowedSpecifically Sony proposed to eliminate 10560 square feet of arcade reducing it from 14102 to 3542 square feet and to replace it with 6050 square feet of indoor retail space much of it along the Madison Avenue frontage Were this all to the proposal the answer would be easy since Sony not only would be decreasing public space but would also be increasing private floor area What made this a matter for legitimate public debate was Sonys sweetener its offer to enlarge its covered pedestrian space located at the rear of the building and connecting East 55th and 56th Streets from 5625 square feet to 9731 square feet and to render it climate controlled Sony was offering an additional 4106 square feet of covered pedestrian space and a general enhancement of its qualities in exchange for a reduction of 10560 square feet of asofright arcade Sony also proposed to eliminate 1324 square feet of retail space fronting the covered pedestrian space and to replace the ATT Infoquest Center with its own exhibit center called SonyWonder Technology Lab in the annexThe zoning arithmetic worked out as follows Reflecting the judgment that square foot for square foot a covered pedestrian space is more valuable to the public and more expensive to construct than an arcade the Zoning Resolution generally authorized a substantially greater bonus per square foot of covered pedestrian space In the Sony case at a rate of 11 square feet of bonus floor area for every square foot of covered pedestrian space the additional covered pedestrian space would generate a bonus of 45166 square feet At a rate of three square feet of bonus floor area for every square foot of arcade the lost 10560 square feet of arcade would reduce the buildings zoning floor area entitlement by 31680 square feet Thus even after Sony would have constructed 6050 square feet of new retail space in the old arcade space that would still leave it with an unused entitlement of more than 7000 square feet of building And that would be before counting the 1324 square foot reduction of retail space in the covered pedestrian space In short in the arcane world of zoning bonuses for privately owned public spaces it could be argued the public would emerge more than whole with less but more valuable public space The City agreed with this reasoning and approved Sonys application in 1992 concluding that the public benefit associated with the changes exceeded the public benefit associated with the existing configurationTodays covered pedestrian space an impressive glasscovered threestory throughblock corridor may be entered from East 55th or 56th Streets under the remaining portion of outdoor arcade left over from the original design or through the 80foothigh granite entry arch and intensely vertical private lobby of the Sony building from Madison Avenue Enclosed above by a halfbarrel vaulted glass ceiling supported by white metal lattice and transverse white industrial beams and at both ends by glass the space is light and airy Indeed in physical form it comes the closest of any throughblock privately owned public space in the city toward evoking the nineteenthcentury European arcade with Connecticut granite for the patterned floor and columns even if the half vault and squeezed corridor evoke half an arcade and recent intrusions including a large frame with light bulbs hanging from the ceiling and bumpout windows from the sides clutter the air The spaces overall transparency and axis create a convincing visual as well as functional engagement with 590 Madison Avenues glassenclosed through block arcade and covered pedestrian space to the north forging two blocks of protected midblock passage as well as access through Trump Tower to Fifth AvenueFueled partly by the SonyWonder Technology Lab partly by food and retail offerings and partly by its highly functional amenities for passive activities the space receives heavy use Groups of schoolchildren noisily queue up at and near the Sony exhibit located in an annex at the northern end alternately amused and perplexed by a mechanical barker equipped with live actors voice that interacts conversationally Numerous silver metal movable tables and chairs the same type as those used at 590 Madison and part of Trump are collected principally in the two anterooms located off both ends of the through block passage Here office workers shoppers tourists and other individuals avoid the commotion of the linear corridor as they enjoy typical public space activities of eating reading talking and resting Additional chairs and tables line the corridor and the space has abjured the doubleloaded retail layout of a shopping mall for most of its length A destination restaurant joins convenience retail on the western side and users with long memories and deep pockets might recall the Quilted Giraffe one of the citys most famous and expensive restaurants Public restrooms are available at the SonyWonder annexAs for the lost arcade spaces it would be a mistake to romanticize them During much of the year they were cold dark and windy They were most usable during the dog days of summer when their high vaulted ceilings and heavy granite arches and columns psychologically if not physically fostered coolness much the way the dark mysterious interiors of cathedrals have done for centuries Remaining arcade space still lines East 55th and 56th Street sides of the building retaining the intriguing portholes visibly punched above into the wall,

plaque at Trinity PlaceRetail FrontageSeating: 40 linear feet, 36 chairsTables: 9",,-74.013024,40.706855,55 Broadway,,POPS,10006,Three of the four public spaces at 55 Broadway were mandated by the recently repealed Special Greenwich Street Development District a special purpose zoning district enacted in 1971 to implement an ambitious plan for pedestrian improvements within a 24block area of lower Manhattan bounded by Broadway to the east the World Trade Center complex to the north Battery Park City to the west and Battery Park to the south Unlike traditional zoning districts that declare general rules applying uniformly to all lots within the district the Special Greenwich Street district mapped specific unique mandatory and elective pedestrian circulation and lot improvements blockbyblock requiring or encouraging future developments on such blocks to provide such features The final result was to be an innovative multilevel pedestrian circulation system facilitating movement shopping subway access and enjoyment of open space in the face of an increasingly dense downtownThe greatest danger to this type of zoning is that the real estate market will not cooperate that development will not occur as expected and that the plan thus will be implemented in a piecemeal fashion that fails to accomplish its overall goals Such was the fate of the Special Greenwich Street Development District zoning plan For the lot now occupied by 55 Broadway for example the Special Greenwich Street plan required an enclosed pedestrian bridge spanning Trinity Place easttowest an elevated shopping way some 22 feet above and parallel to Trinity Place a pedestrian connection from that elevated shopping way to Broadway paralleling Exchange Alley and an arcade along Broadway When private development on the other side of Trinity Place did not occur as anticipated the zoning requirement for the enclosed pedestrian bridge was dropped before the bridge was ever constructedThe four legal types of public space that do exist at 55 Broadway were provided to some degree on the assumption that an upperlevel pedestrian network would be constructed Together the four spaces forge a pathway between Broadway and Trinity Place that duplicates the downwardsloping Exchange Alley immediately adjacent to the north Beginning next to the intersection of Broadway and Exchange Alley the narrow urban plaza squeezes pedestrians between the steps leading from the Alley and the arcade under the pianoshaped building edge to the south Further west four round treefilled planters on one side and banded arcade columns on the other flank a chutelike corridor of increasingly narrow width The covered loggia supplies escalators to navigate the substantial grade change down to the lowerlevel retail shopping arcade beyond which is Trinity Place Without the enclosed pedestrian bridge however the loggia now would have no reason to connect pedestrians to an upperlevel elevated shopping way directly above the existing lowerlevel shopping arcade along Trinity Place that were together known as a shopping way and had been required by the Special Greenwich Street Development District zoning Thus like the bridge the elevated shopping way component of the shopping way was dropped by the City in 1992 That effectively ended the hopes for an upperlevel network that would also connect to 45 Broadways similarly mapped but similarly never implemented elevated shopping way along Trinity Place to the southBy comparison another Special Greenwich Street Development District pedestrian improvement amenity suffered an unhappier fate A mandatory open pedestrian bridge spanning Greenwich Street between One Bankers Trust Plaza and a Cityowned lowrise building was actually constructed Unfortunately contrary to expectations the existing lowrise building that housed a City fire station and a fast food restaurant was never replaced by the anticipated new office tower that would justify the bridge After years of carrying no meaningful foot traffic the bridge was recently demolishedEven without the upperlevel network three reasons explain why a pedestrian might choose the 55 Broadway pathway over the adjacent Exchange Alley First much of it is covered Second it is level for much of its run and allows escalators rather than the slope of Exchange Alley to facilitate the descent or ascent Third planter ledges and a movable seating unit that was missing at a recent site visit furnish seating for the momentary stops that pedestrians like to make A recent site visit also revealed café tables and chairs arrayed in the shopping arcade along Trinity Place No record of City approval for this use has been found,
