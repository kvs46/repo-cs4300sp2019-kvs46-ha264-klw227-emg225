Park Avenue Plaza,55 East 52 Street,The first thing to know about Park Avenue Plaza is that it is not located on Park Avenue Its valuable address makes sense however by operation of zoning rules permitting a merger of its zoning lot with that underneath the venerable Racquet  Tennis Club building to the east a structure that indisputably fronts Park Avenue The second thing to know about Park Avenue Plaza is that it has no plaza The third thing to know about Park Avenue Plaza is that its through block arcade is more functionally and visually akin to a throughblock covered pedestrian space as conceived by the Zoning Resolution Although it does connect East 52nd and 53rd Streets between Park and Madison Avenues its primary purpose is to encourage people to stay for substantial periods of time rather than pass through or stop for a momentA potential explanation for the spaces schizophrenia is revealed by its history The owner originally proposed to provide a public galleria once defined in the Zoning Resolution as a continuous covered public space that is occupied by multiple uses such as restaurants boutiques and specialty stores that at its roof level incorporates skylight areas of not less than 20 percent to allow the access of direct sunlight and that is landscaped with elements such as trees flowerbeds movable furniture sitting areas escalators public toilets drinking fountains adequate lighting water features displays works of art cafÃ©s and kiosks    When the owner determined that its office skyscraper no longer required the extra floor area generated by the bonus rate for a public galleria it legally switched to a through block arcade while retaining much of the public galleria design and amenities The result is an elegant twostory glassenclosed indoor space heavily used by an unusually wide spectrum of New YorkersFrom the outside looking in through the greentinted glass on East 52nd and 53rd Streets the climatecontrolled space looks enticing in summer and winter To the east of both entrances are defined seating areas cushioned by small groves of mature ficus trees green shrubbery and flowers Movable tables and chairs are occupied by persons of diverse social and economic backgrounds Chess games are a regular activity An occasional bird flies aboveSandwiched between these two passive activity alcoves is an eating area buffered on its three open sides by two kiosks and a narrow ledge The food kiosk offers breakfast and lunch consumed by patrons at rows of cafÃ© tables and chairs The admonition on a sign states All seating available to public and no purchase of food or beverage required Next to the cafÃ© seating on the eastern wall is a slick twostory black stonebacked waterfall covered by a skylight The sound of cascading water modulates the otherwise hard acoustics of this space The piano music further softens the atmosphereAlthough not legally part of the public space the adjacent retail shopping arcade past the elevators to the west is worth visiting Its design is vaguely reminiscent of European shopping arcades and features outsized glass storefronts for each business The two public restrooms are located next to the elevators,-73.973646,,10022,https://apops.mas.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/blackrockparkaveplaza.jpg,40.75908,,Manhattan,,"Artwork: wall art on west walls, sculptureBicycle ParkingClimate Control: air conditioning and heatingDrinking Fountain: 1 next to elevators west of Through Block ArcadeFood Service: 290 sf retail kioskLighting: minimum 20 foot candles during day, minimum 15 fc during night, light accents on green walls, fountain lightingLitter Receptacles: 6Other Required: skylight, glass crystal detail and lighting on east wall, 8 transparent glass floor to ceiling columnsPlanting: 820 sf including 3 large planters, 1 planter along east wall, vertical green walls, and ground coverPlaque/Sign: 2 plaques on East 52nd Street, 2 plaques on East 53rd Street, 1 plaque in interior corridor, public restroom signage, restroom location indicator panelRestrooms: 2 ADA-accessibleRetail Frontage: 78 feet facing Through Block Arcade, composed of minimum 2 storesSeating: 136 movable seats, 14 linear feet planted ledges, 24 lf bench seatingTables: 48Trees within Space: large trees, bamboo treesWater Feature: 340 sf ornamental fountain",POPS,Restricted

Deutsche Bank,31 West 52 Street,Visually and functionally the primary portion of this urban plaza is the wide outdoor throughblock corridor connecting West 52nd and 53rd Streets east of Sixth Avenue between the CBS building to the west and the Deutsche Bank building to the east Changes to the asofright plaza zoning regulations in 1975 and 1982 introduced enhanced amenity and design requirements for plazas at office buildings in midtown including a general prohibition against northfacing spaces The need for such a prohibition had become obvious Plazas obtained under the asofright 1961 plaza rules could face north and such an orientation too often created dark cold relatively inhospitable placesAlthough it appears that this urban plaza has southern frontage on West 52nd Street this is not the case In fact a large piece at the southwest corner of the space actually is part of the CBS building zoning lot Thus in the eyes of zoning the Deutsche Bank urban plaza came to a dead end substantially north of West 52nd Street frontage and thus would have been legally prohibited Because it is impossible for planners and lawyers to anticipate every development permutation zoning amendments become necessary correctives It is not uncommon for new and unexpected fact patterns to trigger reexamination of existing zoning rules Here because the plaza could de facto if not de jure secure southfacing frontage if it could make an arrangement with CBS to use some of its zoning lot it would make little sense to prohibit it Thus the City Planning Commission in 1983 approved a zoning amendment allowing a northfacing urban plaza such as the one here if such plaza is contiguous to an open area fronting on a south facing street line on an adjoining zoning lot to form a through block plaza The owner of the Deutsche Bank building zoning lot entered into an agreement with the owner of the CBS building zoning lot that permitted the Deutsche Bank building owner to add 416722 square feet of CBS lot to its urban plaza thereby forming the throughblock plaza required by the zoning Form and substance became oneThe urban plaza is formal even austere in its appearance Where the surfaces of public spaces are sometimes all brick or all concrete the surfaces here are all granite interrupted briefly by dashes of colorful flowers Seven imposing redgranite piers rise four stories along the building lobby to the east deemed by one critic as AztecEgyptian temple postmodern At the western edge across the granite floor is a blocklong serpentine seating ledge with a back that serves as planter wall for a row of trees and colorful flowers At north and south ends of the corridor are small planters with builtin benches trees and flowers Halfway between West 52nd and 53rd Streets is a 22foothigh sculpture entitled Lapstrake 1987 by sculptor Jesus Bautista Morales composed of horizontal polished granite slabs alternating with slabs and pieces of roughhewn graniteThe connection between the CBS building popularly known as Black Rock and the Deutsche Bank building is not solely a matter of zoning Access between this urban plaza and the CBS plaza is provided down several steps Furthermore the CBS building was designed by Eero Saarinen the FinnishAmerican architect known among other things for his flowing airline terminals at Kennedy and Dulles Airports in collaboration with architects Kevin Roche and John Dinkeloo The RocheDinkeloo firm also designed the Deutsche Bank building first known as the EFHutton building Additional urban plaza may be found in the form of more sidewalk on West 52nd and 53rd Street sides of the building,-73.978013,,10019,https://apops.mas.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/P1030490.jpg,40.760925,,Manhattan,,"Artwork: granite sculptureLighting: 2.3 lumensLitter Receptacles: 6.1 cubic feet required, 12 cf providedPlantingPlaque/Sign: 2Retail FrontageSeating: 308 linear feet required, 311 lf providedTrees on Street: 3Trees within Space: 6 required, 10 provided",POPS,24

Goldman Sachs,85 Broad Street,Like many of its neighboring office towers the Goldman Sachs building was developed in around and over a historically significant part of the city The tower is adjacent to two historic districts designated by the Citys Landmarks Preservation Commission East is the Stone Street Historic District designated in recognition of its 17th and 18thcentury Dutch colonial street pattern of New Amsterdam and treasure trove of stylistically representative 19th and early 20thcentury smallscale merchant and commercial buildings erected after a devastating fire in December 1835 South across Pearl Street is the Fraunces Tavern Block Historic District and its early 19thcentury lowrise structures that survived the fireWhen landmark buildings are threatened by new development public policy solutions have ranged from requiring the complete preservation of the building to grafting building elements most notably the historic faÃ§ade onto the new structure Solutions involving lessthanfull historic preservation inevitably raise controversy To some such solutions represent faux historic preservation and are rejected outofhand To others such solutions reflect the pragmatic outcome of complex balances that are necessarily struck between preservation interests and other economic and social interests in the highstakes cauldron of urban development politics and the physical evolution of cities With its Villard Houses courtyard the New York Palace Hotel at 457 Madison Avenue is a good example of this debateHere the historic issues principally involved streetand belowstreet level conditions rather than existing buildings and the public spaces became a major avenue for addressing them To begin with the new building was built directly on a portion of Stone Street whose historic lineage dates back to the 17thcentury period of Dutch settlement To enable the towers construction the City demapped and closed Stone Street between Broad Street and Coenties Alley but required that the alignment of the new buildings lobby follow the Stone Street alignment and be a publicly accessible lobby through which the public could walk as if on Stone Street from Broad Street to Coenties Alley after which the real Stone Street continues to the east A 1980 press release announcing the buildings development described the lobby path as the Spirit of Stone StreetOwing to security concerns expressed by Goldman Sachs in the summer of 1999 the Department of City Planning agreed to the owners installation of turnstiles inside the building at both ends of the lobby corridor Members of the public wishing to enter and pass through the lobby must now approach the security desk where an attendant will immediately activate the turnstile to permit public passage In addition the building must post three signs one at each entrance to the building stating that the public is welcome to follow the route of Stone Street and a third installed by Heritage Trails New York in the adjacent urban plaza describing the historic significance and configuration of Stone StreetThe public spaces here adopt another convention for recognizing the past special paving patterns plaques and exhibits that depict and explain the historic significance of the site For example the paving pattern of the sidewalk widening along Broad Street beckons the pedestrian to the building entrance where a bronzecolored map derived from a 1660 drawing is set into the sidewalk surface Along with brown paving stones the map shows the original alignment of Stone Street then called Hoog Straat leading directly through the buildings lobby as well as the location of other Dutch city landmarks including Fort Amsterdam the Bowling Green and Marketfield StreetOther plaques and exhibits in and out of the urban plaza and arcade next to Pearl Street describe how one of the citys largestever archaeological excavations was conducted onsite with 30 archaeologists from 1979 to 1980 how it uncovered wells privies and cisterns from the backyards of early Dutch houses and how it located the foundation of a 17thcentury Dutch tavern that became New Yorks first city hall Embedded transparent horizontal display covers reveal some of the archaeological material unearthed during this project including an 18thcentury cistern complete with household refuse and the taverns foundation walls Gray paving stones outline the approximate location of the rest of the taverns walls while creamcolored paving indicates the ground covered by the structureThe linear throughblock urban plaza east of the building provides a functional space for relaxing and eating food purchased from neighboring cafÃ©s and stores on adjacent Coenties Alley Two rows of 20 planters with trees

Marlborough,245 East 40 Street,The main part of this plaza is located at the back of the building on the north side of East 40th Street west of Second Avenue A sixfoot retaining wall along the public sidewalk signals the existence of the small elevated area up a narrow ramp and past a gate The initial view is of dumpsters arrayed near the buildings service entrance behind a planter and representing the only association between the building and the space Near the East 40th Street perimeter is a planter with tree and sculptural stone objects arising out of a gravelandstone floor A bicycle rack is the only other notable attribute here The remaining plaza area wraps around the building at the northwest corner of East 40th Street and Second Avenue A row of birch trees grows out of a long planter with spiked interior ledge on East 40th Street The avenue side features a small semicircular dropoff driveway the arcade at the front door and several additional planters with spikesBecause this plaza is directly across East 40th Street from the Highpoints residential plaza and the Vanderbilts residential plaza is immediately west of the space comparisons are all but unavoidable This space and the Highpoint for example are roughly the same size but they differ dramatically in appeal functionality and integration with their host building The explanation is not hard to uncover Completed in 1973 the Marlborough produced its space under the lenient asofright plaza standards set forth in the original 1961 Zoning Resolution while the Highpoint completed its space 15 years later under the residential plaza zoning standards enacted in 1977 Such history and propinquity all but guarantee that this space will not be used in its present condition,-73.973358,,10017,https://apops.mas.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/245-E.-40th-St.-3.jpg,40.748922,,Manhattan,,No required amenities,POPS,24

Then, they ask me to give my CC info over text, which I don't feel comfortable doing since I have no idea who or what I'm texting and I already paid for the Groupon. I try calling to give it over the phone since they insisted, but no answer. Try calling the next day, no answer. Do this for 5 days and finally text them to say I've been trying to call and so they call me and tell me they were on the other line. Lie...were they really on the other line 4 days in a row? Sure. So then they say they ""reviewed our conversation"" and would like to let me know that unfortunately despite my upcoming appointment, one of their machines is broken so they have to move my appointment and ask if a month later is ok. A MONTH. Apparently they only have 2 machines and one can only be used by one technician so there's nothing they can do. No new machine, no fixing the broken one, no having someone ELSE just use the one they have to open up appointments. No thank you. Asking Groupon for my money back and spending it elsewhere. Somewhere with better customer service and work ethic.

If you have never been on an aircraft carrier this is you chance to learn how large this key to winning of World War Two was. It is an impressive city on the water that contains thousands of sailors and was very important during the Cold War and is still very important. The fee to see this museum is reasonable and if you are a veteran, there is no fee. I would recommend that you spend at least three hours during your visit as there is so much to see. This included a visit to the inside of the submarine and also the interior of the aircraft carrier. There are also guides that will explain about each of the areas you visit on the aircraft carrier. Also the submarine has excellent diagrams about the history of this important navy ship and explain how they were able to save it from the scrap yard and bring it from the west coast near Seattle to its final resting place here in New York City.

Good place to go to unwind a bit in the midst of the city madness. /AUTHOR: Annalisa Rivera /RATING: 4 /TEXT: Tompkins Square Park is a nice little neighborhood spot to visit, especially on a good weather Sunday. Parents gather with kids to play on the playground; dog lovers hit the dog park area with thier pups; there's a concrete area used for a variety of sports like floor hockey, and in the heat of summer, you'll find folks lounging on the grass.  Personally, I enjoy the Sunday farmer's market. They are best mid spring too late fall, but open year round, and accept EBT. There's also a place at the market where you can compost food scraps and donate clothing to help the planet a bit.   Not what I'd call a tourist destination, but certainly a cozy spot for locals to enjoy a slice of nature and neighbors. /AUTHOR: Preston Bebas /RATING: 5 /TEXT: Nice park.

Avenue of the Americas,1251 Sixth Avenue,This plaza is the northernmost of three titanic privately owned public spaces that occupy a threeblock stretch along the west side of Sixth Avenue from West 47th to 50th Streets in front of skyscrapers built for corporate headquarters From south to north are the approximately 20000squarefoot space at 1211 Sixth Avenue formerly the Celanese building the approximately 37000 square feet of space at the McGrawHill building and this almost 30000squarefoot plaza at what once was known as the Standard Oil and Exxon buildings Each public space was built in the early 1970s as part of the Rockefeller Center development complex each was designed by the same architecture firm Harrison and Abramovitz each was conceived and executed in contemplation of the other two and each boldly projected the view of New York City as a center of corporate power Unexpectedly their collective presence ignited a firestorm of criticism over the 1961 Zoning Resolutions legal embrace of the tower in the park conceptThe problem was not inherent in the idea that a dense urban core like midtown Manhattan would need breathing spaces Indeed several blocks to the east Mies van der Rohes 1958 Seagram Building with its elegant plaza and duet of flanking fountains on Park Avenue between East 52nd and 53rd Streets remains the citys quintessential International Style masterpiece of tower in the park architecture as well as a strong element of urban design But one must wonder how the Seagram space and Park Avenue itself would have fared had adjoining parcels mimicked the Seagram design The very contrast of neighboring buildings and massings from McKim Mead  Whites masonry lowrise Racquet and Tennis Club across the street to the angled floating tower of Skidmore Owings  Merrills Lever House to the less distinguished but pleasantly differentiated buildings to the north and south on the east side of Park Avenue help secure Seagrams legacyTo many urban observers the 1961 Zoning Resolutions de facto reliance on the massing of the Seagram Building as a model for its highdensity commercial district zoning envelope was mistaken These observers argued that the asofright license granted to developers to replicate without regard to neighborhood context the towerplaza typology in return for a 101 zoning bonus ruined this part of Sixth Avenue as well as other areas of the city The plazas substituted vacant windswept spaces for buildings built to the front lot line destroying a sense of visual containment and allowing a grievous hemorrhaging of street energy otherwise fostered by retail frontage and constrained sidewalks Although not every observer had such a negative view of the Sixth Avenue spaces  indeed some admired their aesthetic presence others their perimeter treatment along the sidewalk that engendered substantial sitting on ledges  the basic critique persevered and culminated in substantial plaza zoning reform in 1975 that would generally prohibit the plaza typology of the Sixth Avenue groupingHere a large bright turquoise pool dominates the space Water jets spray upward at the center and water spills down at back to a slender lower level Ledge seating at front and back permits physical contact with the water In good weather the Sixth Avenue ledge is packed with people backs to the water eyes glued to the choreography of pedestrians and moving vehicles on the sidewalk and street Although the size and presentation of the pool are impressive they raise a question about how open and accessible to the public or how usable a public space is if it is largely covered by water landscaping or other elements that prevent physical access According to the original 1961 Zoning Resolutions definition of an asofright plaza ornamental fountains    shall be considered permitted obstructions One that covers this much of a space however pushes the concept Indeed without a narrow corridor between the back of the pool and the front of the building a corridor that from time to time has been blocked by planters pedestrians would have as much difficulty crossing this space as if the tower itself had been built to its front lot line Other spaces that have installed huge amounts of landscaping with like effect raise similar questions about predominantly visual as opposed to physically usable asofright plazas Physical usability here at least is supplied along the fountain edge at the sidewalk and at north and south ends of the plaza fronting Sixth Avenue where elevated rectangular terraces furnish benches trees and planting These terraces are similar to the ones one block south at the McGrawHill building flanking its sunken plaza More plaza space extends westward along West 49th and 50th Streets in front of the building entrancesThe space at the back of 1251 Sixth Avenue is about to undergo an identity change of potentially longterm benefit to the public The issue at least in recent years has not been the quality of the space a verdant parklike area known as Exxon Park between West 49th and 50th Streets In what has been a surprising revelation to many public space experts however the park never was part of the buildings privately owned public space A declaration of easements covenants and restrictions made by the owner in December 1986 described it as a park plaza or pedestrian mall but expressly reserved its use principally to persons connected with this building and not to the general public Thus although it has been heavily used by members of the general public for many years it was never obligated to be open to the public by zoning rules All this will change however when the proposed world headquarters for Morgan Stanley Dean Witter  Company at 745 Seventh Avenue is constructed on the lot to the west along West 50th Street The developer of that site obtained a City special permit obligating it to reconstruct this space according to a new design approved by the City Planning Commission During the construction phase of the building the space will be closed to the public and will reopen when the building is ready for occupancy The profile for 745 Seventh Avenue shows an image of that future spaceUntil construction begins and if the existing space is maintained for public use then it is certainly worth a visit The West 49th Street side is lined with tables and chairs used by a restaurant to the east and wooden planters and benches to the west The West 50th Street side takes advantage of the extra area created by a recess in the back of the building and provides two zones of activity In one the focus is on food Two kiosks face each other and offer refreshment for users seated at cafÃ© tables and chairs arrayed on a raised wooden platform The area to the east is for quieter activities Mature trees and wooden benches furnish a rustic quality A waterwall and pool tacked onto the back of the building mask noise and are easily approached down several steps A sculpture by J Seward Johnson Jr called Out to Lunch 1980 sets the right example a seated man is eating a sandwich and reading a book about offshore saltwater fly fishingA combination of public and private spaces at the backs of Sixth Avenue towers creates a fourblock midblock pedestrian network starting from the landscaped pedestrian plaza at Stevens Tower and ending here It is also worth noting that the Sixth Avenue plaza to the north and in front of the TimeLife Building between West 50th and 51st Streets was built before the 1961 Zoning Resolutions plaza provision and never received a bonus,-73.981612,,10020,https://apops.mas.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/2012-1251_Sixth_Ave-d-e1351197054227.jpg,40.759971,,Manhattan,1.33,No required

"55 WATER STREET, New York, NY 10041",55 Water Street,Surrounded by Water Street the southwest side of Old Slip and South Street this building has two of the largest outdoor public spaces in the city and some of the best views of Brooklyn and the East River The plaza at street level is a long rectangular windswept sea of brick extending from Water Street to South Street along the southwest side of the building Near Water Street is a stairwell leading to a defunct belowground shopping mall A channel of water used to flow from the plaza toward and down the stairwellVisually the plaza looks much larger than its legally required size because it is seamlessly joined to the Cityowned triangular Vietnam Veterans Plaza formerly known as Jeanette Park to the southwest The owner of 55 Water Street was required by a City special permit to rebuild and maintain Jeanette Park and the privately owned and publicly owned public spaces appear to function as one spaceAgainst the foreground of the plazas open brick surface and just across the invisible border between privately owned and Cityowned space is the New York Vietnam Veterans Memorial an upright rectangular slab composed of translucent greenishglass blocks etched with the contents of poignant letters and other writings from American soldiers in Vietnam to their families and friends back in the United States The wall is pierced by two portals framed in granite that symbolically allow the viewer to enter however briefly the soldiers world before passing safely to the other side At night the monument is lit from within creating an eerie ghostlike sensation befitting the subject matter The memorial was a product of a design competition initiated in 1982 by a Cityestablished commission and the winning entry was conceived and completed by architects Peter Wormser and William Fellows and writer John Ferrandino in 1984 to 1985On the Vietnam Veterans Plaza side of the memorial is an amphitheater with stepped brick seating chiseled out of the grade change At the top of the brick steps are stubby blackmetal bollards strung with lights which create a necklace effect in the evening The remaining area southwest features

elevated space expressly created under the Zoning Resolutions specific provision for elevated plazas Entry is from Water Street up the escalators or stairs or from South Street up a narrow stairwell In past years the space has been closed from time to time because among other things repairs to the escalators had to be made While repair renovation and construction projects may legitimately preclude public access for a limited period they cripple public use when such projects linger for months or even years or recur on an alltooregular basis In this case the City and owner have exchanged numerous letters in the past about lack of access most recently addressing the issue in 1997The space itself is interesting especially for the views it permits of the East River and Brooklyn with its skyline redolent of 19th and early 20thcentury New York To the northeast across Old Slip is a birdseye view of the building that is home to New York Citys Landmarks Preservation Commission The elevated plaza measures close to an acre divided between an empty flat brick surface and a curving raised terrace composed of planters water pools sittable ledges and wood benches Here are semiprivate and private areas protected from the wind that are particularly pleasant during hot summer daysIn the outdoor public space lexicon elevated and sunken are controversial qualifiers Such spaces especially the elevated ones can be remote inconvenient even scary removed from the familiarity and security of street eyes and ears They can also harm the vitality of the sidewalk itself by creating a lacuna in the adjacent ground plane At its inception the zoning definition of the asofright plaza precluded the elevated or sunken plaza requiring that all plazas be no more than five feet above or more than 12 feet below the curb level In part to accommodate this space the City in 1968 enacted a zoning amendment allowing elevated plazas following a discretionary review by the City Planning Commission The City approved this space in the hope that it would become one component in a secondlevel pedestrian circulation network extending east over the FDR Drive to the river Like the effort in the Special Greenwich Street Development District which attempted to create another secondlevel pedestrian circulation network on the other side of downtown this one never came to fruition The profile of public spaces at One Bankers Trust Plaza discusses the Special Greenwich Street Development District plan in more detailThe remaining public space at 55 Water Street includes an arcade that wraps around half of the Water Street side of the building and continues along the full southwest side Additional plaza area that is effectively more sidewalk may be found on Water Street between the entrance to the elevated plaza escalators and Old Slip,-74.009154,,10004,https://apops.mas.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/55-Water-Street-a.jpg,40.703183,,Manhattan,4,"Escalator: Elevated Plaza,

HPD wants to use it to develop a residential building, which will be very detrimental to our garden operations.

It is located in Chinatown, NYC,   and situated behind the NYC Criminal Court on Baxter and Bayard Street.    The park is kind of big for a NYC park, and it does have a basketball court, lawn for soccer matches, lots of benches in and outside the park, playground for the kids and toddlers with swings and other equipment.    Then there tables and chairs also, some are chess tables and some are like picnic tables and long benches.  Plenty of tress and bushes also.  So breakfast and lunch in the park is great on beautiful NYC days.  The folks that frequents the park are moms & kids, nanny & kids, kids from schools there for recess, folks playing basketball,  folks playing soccer,  Attorneys,  District Attorneys, judges, Court Officers and Correction Officers.  It is 1 of the safest park in NYC.   However, It would be a great NYC park to enjoy except there is a bunch of middle age and elderly locals ( men and women)  that occupies the park on a daily basis 365 days a year, and they occupied almost all the tables every day.  What these folks do is play all sorts of card games and other table games all day long, and they just grab and hold the tables for their games.  These folks also have some bad habits besides their bad manners, and I can not even name them for you  except to say to they should stop their bad habits in a NYC park.  The park does entertain tons of folks on a daily basis,  and there are NYC  Park's Department employees  on hand throughout the day maintaining  the park.    However, the park always seems dirty and unkempt whenever I visited.   The several public toilets in the park is real dirty and usually overflowing with some water from somewhere.

Hello, I was a prior alumni for this school and I prefer to stay anonymous. This school is a painfully hard experience if you are/were a kid just trying to learn or partake in extracurricular activities. The teachers are biased towards certain children. For example, if you were a (troubled) child they would let you freely roam the school whenever you wanted to as well as say whatever you wanted to whoever you wanted without consequence while, If you were a goal oriented/ quiet / non trouble making kid, they wouldn't even let you use the bathroom much less talk out of place once without the risk of detention or a phone home. This slackness not only causes the bad kids to make trouble for the good children but makes the good children aspire to be as bad as the bad kids because of the faculty's negligence and bad decision making along with the perceived privileges to be received amongst being rebellious. How do I know this? I was bullied very harshly (along with my female cousin and my friends) because we were those few kinds of kids still willing to learn the material rather than be bad or make a name for themselves. Also, it would be wise of you to teach your kid how to fight before attending this school because not only does this school have a lot of fights amongst themselves but they also fight other schools aswell ! I was jumped on a staircase, jumped on my way to school later getting stomped out and even had a knife pulled on me. Report after report after report and nothing was done. My mom even went as far as to file a police report and the school tried to lie and say it was off school grounds even though it was inside the school's recess yard. Sadly all the reports aimed towards the faculty fell on deaf ears and nothing was resolved but somehow the bullies heard just fine since they always found out you told on them. So before you were getting fought for no reason and now you were getting fought for snitching. I remember I finally said enough was enough and I tried to walk out. As I neared the door a security guard took me to the assistant principal's office to talk about it and I explained everything to her from the bullying to the teachers withholding vital learning material to let the kids do whatever they wanted during class. She took away my prom , every school trip for the rest of the year, detention for the rest of the week and threatened my graduation. I was crushed. After that day I just stopped going and it was pretty early in the school year as well. A month before graduation I got a call from them stating I had good enough test scores and work grades prior to leaving so it was possible for me to graduate even though they robbed me of 3 years of my childhood and education. Lucky me right? Listen, whether you want to send your kid here or not is up to you but if your kid is a hard working, ambitious, quiet or even generally good person please don't send them here. It still haunts my cousin, friends and I that we had to go through all of that just to get a education from that school. /AUTHOR: Rabia Asif /RATING: 4 /TEXT: I loved all my teachers, just had very little trips, but, still one of my best memorable places ever! /AUTHOR: Valentino /RATING: 1 /TEXT: The worst school ever mad fights all most very day but at the school there is only 4 good teachers mister nickaleta miss sagen mister  shocen /AUTHOR: Isaiah Gaming /RATING: 3 /TEXT: The School ain't so good but it's good.

Strathmore,400 East 84 Street,Unlike some Upper East Side residential plazas that use high planters to create internalized isolated space away from the street or that separate the residential entrance from the rest of the space this rectangular brick residential plaza at the southeast corner of First Avenue and East 84th Street is content to open itself up to full scrutiny from everyone Although planters line much of its perimeter they are low and thus do not create any visual barrier to the space Curved ledge seating along the wellmanicured planters is available in various configurations at east and west ends disappointing only because tiny vertical stone slabs subdivide the ledge into individual units Indeed the only ledge without the dividers has a railing that fully prevents seating Is it really necessary to stop individuals from slouching or lying down at this spaceIf outsiders are generally welcomed by design insiders are pleasantly integrated as well The entrance to the building is in the middle of the primary space and the capacious pathway is not covered by a long canopy or otherwise distinguished by segregating structure or planters By placing the lobby entrance right in the middle the doorman can see and be seen providing a sense of security and care that is evident in the high levels of maintenance here At the eastern end of the space behind a gate is visual residual space with more landscaping and a pathway not legally required to be accessible to the public Nonetheless a restaurant and outdoor seating entice the user to enter,-73.950164,,10028,https://apops.mas.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/20121205_400_E_84-b.jpg,40.775165,,Manhattan,,"Bicycle Parking: Primary Space: 10 spacesDrinking Fountain: Primary Space: 1LightingPlanting: Primary Space: 1,319.62 sf required, 1,679.87 sf provided; Visual Residual Space: 3,034.95 sfPlaque/SignSeating: Primary Space: 159.92 linear feet including 8 lf with backs required, 168.5 lf including 16 lf with backs providedTrees on Street: 10Trees within Space: Primary Space: 8",POPS,24

Olympic Tower,645 Fifth Avenue,Over its quartercentury life the Olympic Tower throughblock covered pedestrian space linking East 51st and 52nd Streets has faced the awesome challenge of competing for public space users with one of the worlds greatest shopping streets Fifth Avenue Why should anyone go to this space when Fifth Avenue runs parallel some 50 feet to the west and the spaces existence is not even evident to the average Fifth Avenue pedestrian If the space were to succeed as a destination it would have to offer more than simple protection from the elements Although it contributed to the creation of a parallel pedestrian circulation system along with the HarperCollins through block arcade to the north connecting East 51st to 53rd Streets the closeness of Fifth Avenue would decrease the shortcut appeal The spaces longstanding history of scant public use restaurant closings and absent retail tenants only underscores the difficulty of the competition At a recent site visit the space was under renovation suggesting that its owner is still trying to discover the right design including amenities and other uses that would make it a successEntered from East 51st Street across from St Patricks Cathedral or from East 52nd Street across from the southern end of the HarperCollins through block arcade the space observes the twozone design convention of several enclosed throughblock covered pedestrian spaces dedicating part of the space to circulation and part to destination functions Here the western portion is dedicated to movement and access to the elevators for the commercial space in Olympic Tower Without retail stores or seating along this western side there is no reason to linger stop or change directionThe eastern portion lying out of circulations way accommodates the functional amenities although the proposed renovation may change this arrangement Closest to East 51st Street is a small area that has yet to find its identity Previously used for restaurant seating general seating and an adjacent newstand it has been subject to renovation efforts several times before Toward the middle are the restrooms and in the past a cafÃ© Tables and chairs arrayed on two tiers descending northward overlook a granitebacked waterfall and basementlevel pool When the waterfall is in operation a mirror creates the illusion of more water A vacant glassenclosed room at pool level visible but inaccessible from above is all that remains of unsuccessful restaurant efforts Close to East 52nd Street was the only tiny retail location that had operated consistently although it appears to be closedThe presence of a parallel throughblock covered pedestrian space so close to Fifth Avenue raises an interesting urban planning question What is wrong with walking and shopping on Fifth Avenue That the City at one time allowed even encouraged the creation of an alternative circulation network and offthestreet spaces that would draw pedestrians and shoppers away from retailers on Fifth Avenue may seem strange today In the early 1970s however city planners were worried that the Fifth Avenue public sidewalks were becoming so crowded that the experience of shopping and promenading was being compromised They were also concerned that passive uses such as travel agencies and bank branches were squeezing out active retail uses that made Fifth Avenue the success it wasTo address these issues the City adopted in 1971 the Special Fifth Avenue District a zoning district designed among other things to preserve protect and enhance the character of Fifth Avenue as the showcase of New York and national retail shopping and to encourage the concentration of major stores retail clustering restaurants and related activities which complement the special image and character of this unique area Midblock parallel pathways and interior spaces strategically deployed were seen as devices that could alleviate some of the sidewalk congestion for the greater good of the street The only problem of course was the enormous odds against creating anything remotely providing the vitality of a real street that would in fact siphon off pedestrians The stretch of Fifth Avenue between East 42nd and 57th Streets offers in addition to spaces at Olympic Tower and HarperCollins covered pedestrian spaces at 575 Fifth Avenue 650 Fifth Avenue and Trump

It's a 3 day event and I think all 3 days is a perfect amount of time to get as much entertainment in for what's being offered here. The wide variety of food they offer is amazing from vegan options to meat eaters they seem to have everything covered. I deducted a star for the outrageous prices they charge for admission and food. Two cocktails were $36 and they were in small plastic cups loaded with ice. I had asked for no ice one time and they said that its something they could not do unless they only fill it up half. I thought that was super tacky. For the amount of money we're spending on admission which was a little over $600 for 2 adults/3 days they should have been a little bit more generous with food and drink prices.

So me and my friend constantly had kids bump into us as we tried to go to a part of the park that had less people, we got passed the kids and into the basketball court, and all there was, was a group of teens smoking juul and hookah, and I couldn't stand the smell, so we went to the back, I hate when people smoke in public places like a park.

Ritz,235 West 48 Street,Like other publicly and privately owned public spaces in the city this urban plaza to the west of its host residential tower on the north side of West 48th Street between Broadway and Eighth Avenue has encountered thorny issues regarding its use by certain members of the public At a recent site visit security personnel employed by the Times Square Business Improvement District stated that the plaza has experienced problems with homeless users who have been asked to vacate the space from time to timeHow should privately owned public spaces be used by members of the public In thinking about this question it is important to recognize that use by some individuals may deter use by others Not only is this inevitable but it may even be desirable For example some people like crowds others treasure solitude Some crave excitement others seek quiet When spaces develop a personality they axiomatically stop being all things to all people and with more than 500 public spaces in the city differentiation is to be expected and acceptedStill if everyone need not feel equally at home at every public space at all times no one should feel effectively uninvited at all times In general a bicycle messenger lawyer student traffic officer caregiver construction worker taxi driver or homeless person should be equally entitled to use a public space as long as his or her conduct does not unreasonably impinge upon the ability of others to use the space The key concepts are conduct and unreasonably With regard to conduct it is vitally important to distinguish between conduct and identity The mere identity of a person as homeless no more than the identity of a person as a construction worker or lawyer should never disqualify that person from using the space On the other hand if that persons conduct in the sense of actions taken by that person becomes such a nuisance to others that they are fully prevented from enjoying the space then that person may legitimately be asked to cease such conduct or leave the space Stating the rule in the abstract is of course far easier than drawing lines in the field One individuals definition of reasonable conduct is another persons idea of anarchy but the effort to make reasoned distinctions is essential in societies whose ideals include respect for pluralism and differenceThe owner of The Ritz has taken a customary approach to this issue encouraging greater use of the space during day and evening hours by planning to install open air cafÃ©s and closing the space at night At the time of this writing the space is planned for a renovation as part of its nighttime closing arrangements Thus the four brick planters and wooden benches may become amenities of the past and the user profile may change,-73.986092,,10036,https://apops.mas.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/2012-235_West_48th-e1355180994529.jpg,40.760894,,Manhattan,,"Artwork: Firefighters MemorialLightingLitter Receptacles: 4 cubic feetPlanting: 960 sfPlaque/Sign: 2 entry plaques, 1 informational plaque, 1 hours of access plaqueRetail FrontageSeating: 283 linear feet including 257 lf with backsTables: 8Trees on Street: 17Trees within Space: 12Water Feature: Firefighters Memorial with water",POPS,Restricted

Although it does get boring sometimes, I mean every school is boring but its still very FUN. I love this school!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! /AUTHOR: Yazmurat A. /RATING: 5 /TEXT: This is my favorite school I've ever been in and I'm happy I got in honors class and that was an improvement because I was first in 6-3. Also the teachers, some are pretty chill and its fun and if it was a specialized high school, I would've worked so hard to get in and I prepare to Stuyvesant high school. Over the summer, I was asked if I wanted to go to either Coney Island prep or Marine Park, and I obviously chose my school and I was stressed out when they first said I had to go but then I convinced them but even if I didn't, they gave me a final choice any ways.  Now my top teacher from last year was Ms.Duro. This year it is Mr.Tupper . But for some of the other subject teachers, well, I liked the class better than I liked them no offense!(Not gonna tell who)My class was fun, BUT, the class was horrible in some subjects and ITSELF for example, English, and sometimes Social Studies and science. The other one blames kids on stuff we didn't do and we go off topic which will probably make me like the class more than the teacher :D. Sorry. Anyhoo I had an essay once with I got an 88 and told the teacher I didn't get extra points for typing and I got a 93 which 88 was the grade with extra points its just that it said no extra and when I got the essay it already showed 88 with extra points which means I got an 83 and got extra points but I acted like it was a solid 88 at the start. So basically my grade with the extra points was supposed to be an 88 not 93 and I was unhesitant when I told my teacher and it was verified which therefore means I got 10 added points instead of 5. Another time I couldn't finish an essay because at March 24, at 2017 when I was in 6th grade, I had to get my nose surgery and I was absent for a day of the state exam week because of recovery and at the last exam, I had to get my Doyle splints removed from my nose and I didn't give in the essay and I remember it was marked as a 4. I can get away with homework WAY TO EASILY. Ive done it a lot and I try to be too wise sometimes and I can do it again but one thing I won't do is lie. I didn't say bye to any of my teachers at the last day of 6th grade :c. I haven't said hi  my math and English teacher until November and December, which is funny because Ms.Duro my math teacher was my fav. I saw my art teacher from last year in January 2018 which is also sad because she was too nice.

Cbs,51 West 52 Street,Aptly nicknamed Black Rock this black glass tower designed by the renowned Finnish architect Eero Saarinen and the firm of Kevin Roche John Dinkeloo is surrounded by a waterless moat of plaza steps below the public sidewalk Four midblock cuts in the perimeter of streetlevel ledges provide stairwells that descend five six seven or eight steps from their locations on the north side of West 52nd Street the east side of Sixth Avenue the south side of West 53rd Street and the urban plaza at the Deutsche Bank building The belowstreet plaza space is designed for circulation in and out of the building empty but for planters filled with tall trees at the four corners and some movable chairs located from time to time at the northeast cornerAt street level however the perimeter ledges jump with activity from salespersons hawking artwork and books to unashamed peoplewatchers While the polished stone seating ledge is a hard surface for long perches its generous depth and graduated heights are perfect for accommodating all types and sizes of people For example the ledges along West 53rd Street are lower in height than their West 54th Street counterparts and thus tend to be used by people who prefer to plant their feet firmly on the ground The ledges along West 53rd Street also enjoy southern exposure which may explain their popularity relative to other parts of the perimeterThe adjacent Deutsche Bank urban plaza is worth visiting if only to compare an asofright plaza produced under the original 1961 Zoning Resolution with an urban plaza produced under the more demanding zoning standards enacted in 1975 Although both plazas provide substantial amounts of ledge seating the differences become quickly apparent when the user tries out both Not only is the ledge seating in the urban plaza more comfortable but that space also furnishes landscaping artwork builtin benches and a unified spatial configuration making for a more usable experience overall,-73.978746,,10019,https://apops.mas.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/P1030488.jpg,40.761227,,Manhattan,,No required amenities,POPS,24

Oxford,422 East 72 Street,Pedestrians may be excused for walking past this residential plaza on the south side of East 72nd Street between York and First Avenues Much of the street frontage is occupied by inaccessible visual residual space with a granite wall and metal railing at the lot line and plentiful landscaping of ivy shrubs and small trees beyond The only accessible space the primary space is located behind metal gates and brick columns and mainly serves as a glasscanopied entry corridor for the building For members of the public the salient functional amenity is the polished granite ledge seating that flanks the entry corridor on both sides The adjacent western wall could benefit from landscaping cover or artwork to improve its appearanceThe Zoning Resolution generally discourages northern plazas  plazas that face north  because they inherently lack the sunlight received by plazas with southern eastern or western exposures If a zoning lot has frontage with southern eastern or western exposure then it must normally locate the primary space of its residential plaza on that frontage unless the City Planning Commission waives or modifies the requirement How then did this residential plaza locate itself on the zoning lots northern exposure when the building sits on a throughblock zoning lot with southern exposure frontage on East 71st Street The answer is that this zoning lot is a split zoning lot meaning that it is controlled by two zoning districts Although the R10 zoning district controlling the northern half of the lot allows residential plazas the R8 district governing the southern half does not Thus the owner was not able to place its residential plaza on its southern exposure Ironically once an owner is allowed to provide a northern plaza then the Zoning Resolution is more lenient in terms of required seating and additional amenities than it is for regular residential plazas After all the reasoning goes fewer people will want to sit in a plaza without sunlight,-73.955026,,10021,https://apops.mas.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/422-East-72nd-Street-9-9-14-8.jpg,40.766853,,Manhattan,,Bicycle ParkingDrinking FountainLightingLitter ReceptaclesPlaque/SignSeatingTrees on StreetTrees within Space,POPS,24

There are only about three trees in the lot and on hot days you'll definitely want to park in that shade. This park is right on the water and offers a few fields for soccer, football or softball along with a couple of bike paths. There are lots of trees for shade and being by the water makes for slightly cooler temps on hot days. The grass was mowed and well kept. There is an abundance of space for gatherings and events and there was park staff on hand (rare for any park) to keep the bathrooms stocked with supplies for the crowds. Speaking of bathrooms, they are housed in a modern building with wide open stair access on one side and handicap access on the other. The wide stairs offer views to the water and any event in that area. The only downside is there are no playgrounds or basketball courts, so when bringing kids make sure you have plenty to keep them occupied. /AUTHOR: Shahajahan Pial /RATING: 5 /TEXT: Good place for afternoon walk or morning running..",Bronx,4.2,,Regional Park,unknown

Churchill,728 Second Avenue,It is difficult to appreciate the ample size of this plaza because so much of it is under landscaping A sliver of space parallels the blockfront on the east side of Second Avenue between East 39th and 40th Streets The ledge bordering the manicured bushes flowers and gravel rises along the sidewalk as it makes its way south allowing the user to find that height best suited to his or her seating preference Behind the ledge is a semicircular dropoff driveway although the portion underneath the building itself is not bonused and thus not publicThe majority of plaza surface at north and south sides of the building is covered by an impenetrable diverse landscape of ivy mediumsize bushes and mature fullcanopied trees Birds are heard chirping away in the heart of the space but the closest that human users are able to get is along the perimeter ledges where depending on the ledge slant seating is or is not possible Because this space fails to incorporate the human user in its landscape and indeed renders most of the surface physically inaccessible the question arises how it comports with the 1961 Zoning Resolution That Resolution defined a plaza as an open area accessible to the public at all times not more than five feet above nor more than twelve feet below the curb level of the nearest adjoining street    unobstructed from its lowest level to the sky The only permitted obstructions were arbors or trellises awnings or canopies railings no less than 50 percent open and not exceeding three feet eight inches in height flag poles open terraces or porches steps ornamental fountains or statuary or unenclosed balconies Is the word arbor sufficiently capacious to incorporate this type of landscaping Is it enough that a plaza be visually accessible but physically inaccessible to humans,-73.972838,,10016,https://apops.mas.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/2011-728_Second_Ave-e1353935059645.png,40.748002,,Manhattan,,No required amenities,POPS,24

One Liberty Plaza,1 Liberty Plaza,In future years people will remember 2011 as the year in which physical public space reclaimed its lofty status in the public sphere thanks to the audacious actions of engaged individualsFrom Tahrir Square to Zuccotti Park physical public space has aggressively reminded the world of its centrality in accommodating and nurturing political debate and protestPublic spaces come in many flavors They include cityowned streets sidewalks and parks In New York and other cities they also include a zoningcreated variety known as privately owned public space Through a technique known as incentive zoning New York since 1961 has encouraged developers of office and residential skyscrapers to provide a nowsubstantial array of more than 500 plazas arcades and indoor spaces in return for valuable zoning concessions The most valuable concession of all has been bonus floor area and the City has thus granted more than 20 million square feet of extra building area for developers Although the spaces differ in terms of the legal specifics that created them the signature requirement is that they be usable by the publicZuccotti Park is one such privately owned public space although referring to it as one in 500 understates the seismic role it is currently playing The many actors in this unfolding drama  the activists of Occupy Wall Street using the space spaceowner Brookfield Office Properties various agencies and officials of the Cityincluding the policeas well as neighbors and other members of the public have a stake in understanding the possibilities and limitations for continued occupation Initially at least such greater understanding requires unearthing and characterizing the specific legal actions that created the space Zuccotti Park owes its existence to an incentive zoning transaction memorialized in a 1968 Special Permit that traded zoning concessions other than a floor area bonus in return for this public space variously referred to as a plaza an open landscaped area with trees sitting areas and the necessary lighting and what amounts to a permanent open park in the heart of one of the most densely builtup areas in the world The Special Permit notes importantly that it is principally because of this public benefit that the Commission has viewed this application with favor Although the developer simultaneously secured a substantial floor area bonus for its office tower that bonus was actually for another plaza to the north that wraps around the tower and not for Zuccotti Park In 2005 the City approved an application from the current owner Brookfield to modify the space through such improvements as the planting of 55 honey locust trees the addition of 1010 linear feet of fixed seating 16 fixed tables with fixed seats an abstract steel sculpture and new lighting Brookfield also changed the name of the space from Liberty Park how prescient to Zuccotti Park after the companysÂ  CoChairman John Zuccotti a highlyrespected New York City attorney and former Chair of the New York City Planning CommissionGiven its legal provenance how should one judge the current use of Zuccotti Park by the hundreds of people constituting Occupy Wall Street The true answer is no one knows Unlike most other outdoor privately owned public spaces in New York City Zuccotti Park is a oneoff sui generis as lawyers would say Zuccotti Park is simply what the Special Permit says it is a large and useful plaza that must have amenities of seating tables trees lighting and public art The nature of permissible public use including the legal authority of the owner to impose its own rules to govern the conduct of those within the space is undefined The Zoning Resolution does provide some comparative guidance with regard to four expressly defined categories of plazas including the plaza 1961 urban plaza 1975 residential plaza 1977 and public plaza 2007 Believe it or not different rules attach to each of these categories of plaza and their definitions reflect a relentless chronological march introducing tougher design and amenity requirements to remedy the evident inadequacies of spaces provided under existing law The grandparent of all privately owned public spaces the plain vanilla plaza introduced in the Citys 1961 Zoning Resolution initially required owners to make the space accessible to the public at all times but subsequent zoning amendments motivated in large measure by problems associated with overnight use of spaces by homeless individuals led the City to permit owners of the various plaza categories to apply for authorization for nighttime closings Many owners have applied for and secured such authorizationsNo one knows for sure what the owner of Zuccotti Park would like to do with its space although it hardly stretches the imagination to believe it may like Occupy Wall Street to well occupy Wall Street and not its park If it so desired could the owner legally dislodge Occupy Wall Street Could it for example apply for and receive an authorization from the City for a nighttime closing under existing law The answer is a clear and unambiguous maybe Under one reading of the law the answer is no Section 37727 of the Zoning Resolution states that the City Planning Commission may authorize the closing during certain nighttime hours of an existing or newÂ publicly accessible open area if the Commission finds among other things that a such existing publicly accessible open area has been open to the public a minimum of one year or there are significant operational or safety issues documented and b such closing is necessary for public safety within the publicly accessible open area and maintenance of the public open areas as documented by the applicant But because the phrase publicly accessible open area is a defined term in the Zoning Resolution that refers to the four articulated plaza types plaza urban plaza residential plaza public plaza and since Zuccotti Park is none of the above this option could be understood as unavailable to the owner or City The spirit of the law and an accommodating City interpretation would suggest that owners of Zuccotti Park should enjoy the same ability to apply for an authorization of a nighttime closing as owners of similar plazas created pursuant to the existing zoning categoriesCould Brookfield impose its own rules of conduct that would limit or even prohibit Occupy Wall Street from using the space effectively rendering the current use a trespass To answer this question I need only quote a passage fromÂ Privately Owned Public Space The New York City Experience a book I wrote more than a decade ago in collaboration with the New York City Department of City Planning and the Municipal Art Society of New YorkThe Department of City Planning has taken the position that an owner may prescribe reasonable rules of conduct In determining the definition of reasonable the Department has looked to the rules of conduct applicable in Cityowned parks for general guidance Thus for example the Department has considered a dog leash requirement a ban on the consumption of alcoholic beverages or a prohibition on sleeping in an indoor space to be reasonable On the other hand suggestions by owners that they be allowed to exclude undesirable persons on some basis other than improper conduct or to set limits on the amount of time a member of the public may sit in or otherwise use a space have been considered unreasonableOther fact patterns have and will arise to help sharpen the notion of reasonablenessWhat about rules against listening to a radio playing a musical instrument or inline skating May an owner bar political candidates organizational representatives or activist individuals from seeking signatures for a petition or from handing out literatureThe open question remains then could the owner adopt a rule allowing it to oust or severely limit the activities of Occupy Wall Street Surely any rule crudely prohibiting political activity within the space should fail the reasonableness test And there is no need to impress the US Constitutions First Amendment Free Speech clause to support this argument especially since the First Amendment applies only to government not private action And if it did apply by deeming Brookfield effectively a government actor contentneutral rules regulating the time place and manner of political activity would likely be constitutionally legitimate Instead one need only recognize that there is hardly a more timehonored use of public space than as platform for political activity Cities are about expression of ideas and what better way even in this digital age to express ideas than to gather in one place body to body and express themIronically it is Occupy Wall Streets enormous success that presents the greatest legal challenge Its footprint of occupation is to state the obvious dominant Yes people unassociated with Occupy Wall Street may and do pass through the space wander about chat with movement members take photographs eat a sandwich and read a book But this recitation glosses over the reality that Zuccotti Park has been literally taken over by one group in a way that could easily mitigate the enjoyment of the public space by other members of the public For those seeking the quiet passive enjoyment of what had been they are out of luck For other groups political or otherwise that may be inspired to seek a public space home of their own think political competitors flash mobs organized skateboarders they face a no vacancy sign Brookfields privately owned public space has become privately owned de facto by Occupy Wall StreetThis should not I hope offend Occupy Wall Street Its members are equally members of the public with a right to use Zuccotti Park and they have exercised that right with civility humanity and conviction But as time goes by they should ask themselves whether in satisfying their own needs they are preventing multiple publics from doing the same First in time should not become first in right now and forever more One potential solution would involve a scheduled reduction of their footprint over time freeing up part of the space for other users After all Speakers Corner in Londons Hyde Park is just that a corner of Hyde Park Spatial pluralism may be a dilution but it respectfully responds to the needs of many publics seeking to take advantage of Zuccotti ParkThe City privately owned public space owners and their representatives civic groups like the Municipal Art Society and other interested individuals should seize the moment to commence a public conversation on how best to utilize New Yorks remarkable archipelago of plazas arcades and indoor spaces scattered throughout downtown midtown and the upper east and west sides of Manhattan As recounted inÂ Privately Owned Public Space far too many of these spaces have been disappointments effectively orphaned by private and public inattention or worse Brookfield is not an absentee parent but conceptually Occupy Wall Street may be one of the first to recognize that an orphan is a terrible thing to wasteThat doesnt mean however that political occupation is the palliative Â To be fair most of these spaces are modest neither designed nor equipped for the robust mass engagement represented by Occupy Wall Streets use of Zuccotti Park For spaces that can accommodate larger groups it may now be time to develop citywide rules governing organizational use so that everyone gets a fair shake Â Such approaches are routinely applied in a citys publicowned realm worldwide With the vastness of the inventory not every space has to accommodate every type of public use Â If the outcome of Occupy Wall Streets use of Zuccotti Park results in a discussion about uses of and improvements to public space then its members could add yet another accomplishment to their already impressive achievementsProfile from Privately Owned Public Space The New York City Experience by Jerold S Kayden The New York City Department of City Planning and the Municipal Art Society of New York John Wiley  Sons 2000 Because this profile was published in 2000 it may not accurately reflect current conditionsThe relationship between this office building and a major portion of its public space diverges from the Corbusian tower in the park archetype Unlike the plaza at 140 Broadway across the street this special permit plaza stands alone a fullblock rectangular park bounded by Broadway Cedar Street Trinity Place and Liberty Street liberated from its host office tower by Liberty Street The difference this makes is most keenly understood visually Whereas 140 Broadway gains its architectural clarity by rising straight and uninterrupted from the middle of its capacious gradelevel plaza One Liberty Plaza does not rely on its disconnected plaza for visual definitionCalled Liberty Park the special permit plaza slopes downward from Broadway to Trinity Place Its linear geometry tightly regimented rows of mature trees protected at their roots by square metal grates and ubiquitous stone paving are more redolent of urban than naturalistic landscapes Eight metal benches are regularly used by passersby especially when the weather is hot and the shade of the trees entices On closer examination one of the bench occupants is revealed to be a bronze sculpture entitled Double Check by J Seward Johnson Jr an artist who specializes in bronze lifesize sculptures installed in public places Judging from the startled reaction of plaza users the sculpture could be entitled Double TakeAn elevated ribbon of plaza encircles the fullblock host building above Broadway and Liberty Church

Sheffield,322 West 57 Street,Like the special permit plaza at One Liberty Plaza downtown only more so a substantial section of this plaza is geographically estranged from its parent building Over half of the total plaza area associated with the Sheffield is situated roughly 300 feet west of the building occupying the full blockfront of Ninth Avenues east side between West 56th and 57th StreetsFor about 15 years the northern portion of this plaza space has hosted a popular yearround outdoor greenmarket sponsored by the Citys Council on the Environment on Wednesdays and Saturdays from 800 am to 600 pm Residents and outoftowners alike have made their way along the vendor stalls lining the public sidewalk and the space seeking moderately priced fresh fruit and vegetables baked goods flowers honey and maple syrup mostly originating from New York and surrounding states as well as books and records A particular favorite has been a woman selling dramatic immense sunflowers Vaguely reminiscent of outdoor Parisian markets the greenmarket has become a neighborhood gathering place where relationships between regular customers and longtime vendors have been cementedIn recent years however aspects of the space especially in the nonmarket eastern and southern portions have deteriorated Some of this has been due to the natural aging process experienced by all privately owned public spaces while some has been due to the materials particularly the concrete and shrubbery that require aggressive maintenance and cleaning if they are not to look worn over time Another reason is the existence of the stepped concrete amphitheater in the middle of the eastern portion of the space never animated by consistent programming necessary to make such elements work And finally the space was a geographical orphan so far removed from its parent to the east that it would always be difficult to receive the type of oversight that large spaces requireThat situation is now ending As this book is being written the space is undergoing a substantial renovation The greenmarket along Ninth Avenue will be retained but everything else will change As a result of cooperative efforts of the part of the owner the Department of City Planning and community representatives the space is being physically reinvented under a new design that features usable landscapes and varied functional amenities A generously sized stepped lawn will replace the amphitheater and a garden and trees bordering the eastern boundary will enhance the naturalistic qualities In addition to the lawn seating will be available on a curving ledge on benches and on movable chairs matched with movable tables A food kiosk and cafÃ© terrace at the corner of Ninth Avenue and West 57th Street a bookseller on West 57th Street and a tot lot in the middle will help assure a diverse mix of users at different hours of the day At night the space will be authorized to close at 900 pm during the summer and at 700 pm during the winter In an enlightened and unusual show of respect for its designer the space will be named after Thomas Balsley whose landscape architecture firm has designed or redesigned more privately owned public spaces in the city than any other firmSeveral hundred feet to the east the remaining plaza space runs throughblock between West 56th and 57th Streets immediately west of the Sheffield A throughblock driveway uses the eastern portion while usable space including a small area hidden midblock occupies the western portion Here are six wooden benches alongside planters with trees and bushes and a surprisingly open view to the west over the wall An empty pedestal is the only reminder of a modernist polished metal sculpture by D Durst In the past this tiny area has been used by young bicyclists taking advantage of the slight elevation changes to perfect freestyle tricksBenches and planters are located under and near the slightly elevated arcade on West 56th Street More arcade space is found at the main entrance and on West 57th Street,-73.984238,,10019,https://apops.mas.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/P1030341.jpg,40.766825,,Manhattan,,"Artwork: Plaza (adjacent to Sheffield)Bicycle Parking: Plaza (on Ninth Avenue): 5 spaces;

Great summer spot, Nathan's is nearby. /AUTHOR: Rob Homa /RATING: 4 /TEXT: MCU Park is the cozy home ballpark for the local short-season minor league baseball.  Most players in the NY-Penn League had just finished their college baseball careers before joining the cyclones or their opponents.  The atmosphere mixes the nostaglic feel of the Brooklyn Dodgers with the 'kitsch""' of Coney Island into the standard package of Minor League baseball.  The ballpark is by the ocean which tends to keep the temperature cooler than in many other spots in the city.  You can feel comfortable here at a night game even during a heat wave but also a little chilly when it might be a comfortable summer night in the rest of the city.  Don't be afraid to bring a jacket with you.  This stadium also hosts local college baseball games in March April and May.  These games only draw a handful of people; no concessions are open and only the small family bathrooms are open. I went here for a cunyac doubleheader in early April and had a nice afternoon.  Most of the people at these games were parents of the players.  This year(the spring of 2019) there is a major construction project on Surf Avenue which has closed off the nearby streets and also the sidewalks around the ballpark.  This project should be finished by memorial day so it will not impact the minor league season but expect delays and mostly detours, even when walking.  The B36 bus which has a regular stop at the ballpark is rerouted to Mermaid Avenue, a block away. /AUTHOR: Paul Pavlinovich /RATING: 4 /TEXT: Stuck my head in while visiting the area.

Highpoint,250 East 40 Street,The best portion of this residential plaza is located roughly 200 feet west of Second Avenue on the south side of East 40th Street Unlike some residential plazas that expose themselves either too much or too little to adjacent streets and sidewalk this space shrewdly adopts an intermediate position Half its frontage is open to the sidewalk half is lined by a threefoothigh planter The effect is noticeable from outside and inside Passersby feel that they are graciously admitted and indeed can see over the planter into the space Users within the space savor some sense of separation from the movement and noise of the external world yet enjoy a spectacular view of the Chrysler buildings shining spire to the northwestAnother effective choice is the absence of a separate residential entry corridor Here because the buildings entrance opens directly onto the northeast corner of the space the space itself serves as shared entryway for private residents and public users alike By declining to segregate the two the design promotes a spirit of stewardship that often results in superior upkeep and social interactionInside a combination of enclosure and openness prevails The building to the east a 30foothigh brick wall attached to an adjacent building to the west and four majestic old trees rising from a neighboring lot to the south define the edges of this open redbrick courtyard Indeed it is a happy fortuity that the four trees growing on a lot apparently not belonging to this lot nonetheless serve the space well The featured amenity is a 15foot waterfall serenely descending down graybrown granite tiles that leaven the ubiquitous red brick Sittable ledges ring the water pool and are heavily occupied during warmer days Interior sides of planters offer additional seating possibilities Hidden in back behind the water pool is a small shaded nook whose loose gravel surface and landscaping furnish a secret garden It is easy to imagine a summer movie series utilizing the tall brick wall to the west as movie screen the courtyard filled with a neighborhood audience,-73.973654,,10016,https://apops.mas.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/250-E.-40th-St..jpg,40.74854,,Manhattan,,"Bicycle Parking: Primary Space: 14 spacesDrinking Fountain: Primary Space: 1LightingLitter Receptacles: 14 cubic feet required, 20 cf providedPlanting: Primary Space: 579 sf; Usable and Visual Residual Spaces: 1,031 sfPlaque/SignSeating: 86 linear feet required,104 lf providedTrees on Street: 13Trees within Space: Primary Space: 4; Visual Residual Space: 2 providedWater Feature: Primary Space: 300 sf reflecting pool",POPS,24

It's great for a job around or to just hang out and enjoy the outdoors. /AUTHOR: Olive Gilbert /RATING: 5 /TEXT: Having followed the Statue Cruises map (not reading the text) which places the marker for the Liberty ferry leaving from the jetty at the State Park we were surprised to find we were a good 40min walk from where we wanted to be. Popping into the Rangers office we were bluntly told no ferries left from there, so we enjoyed the waterfront walk instead. A long panorama of the Hudson Bay and seeing Liberty Island from behind made for some good photo opportunities which most visitors wouldn't get. We also read the informative signs along the boardwalk and saw some of the local wildlife. /AUTHOR: Monika Gyongyi Macias Honti /RATING: 4 /TEXT: It is a small park, but if you are looking for a good place to see the sunset and just do a little people-watching it is the perfect spot. Also, you can easily see some of the iconic NY buildings and it is a place full of possibilities and roads you can take: the fery station is literally on one side to the park, the metro station is not far, and there are also many possibilities to look for a tour or just walk around and see what you can find. Just a heads-up, it can get really hot during the summer so if you want to head here probably don't do it when the sun is at its peak and always bring water and a fan to keep the heat at bay. /AUTHOR: Kurt Sorensen /RATING: 3 /TEXT: Green space in new York. But hounded by aggressive sales people.   If you need a close up of lady Liberty then buy a ticket.   If you.just want to see her from the front, & have an hour to kill.

"1166 SIXTH AVENUE, New York, NY 10036",1166 Sixth Avenue,Historically this through block plaza roughly 200 feet east of Sixth Avenue connecting West 45th and 46th Streets has enjoyed one of the highest rates of use of any outdoor public space in the city Its popularity is easy to explain When a space offers abundant seating accessible water features quality landscaping a choice between sun and shade and a variety of public and semipublic zones and when management carefully maintains the space then there is a strong likelihood that the public will use it It should be noted that at the time of this writing a proposal from the owners is in the works to modify the spaceOutside the sidewalk entrances street trees and distinctive sidewalk paving signal that something different is about to occur The frontage is largely occupied by metal fences trees and planter ledges that slope downward and prevent seating so the pedestrian is drawn into the space simply to discover what the fuss is all about Access is provided from the sidewalk up two steps from West 45th Street and eight steps from West 46th Street or from an arcade west of the spaceLike many throughblock spaces functions of circulation and destination are both wellserved here For circulation the arcade provides a covered connection while the through block plazas eastern side provides an openair alternative For destinationoriented users the spaces offer much more People occupy movable darkgreen wire mesh chairs that dutifully line the open corridors western edge and continue obediently along the rectangular sides of a quiet shady subarea next to the West 45th Street entry Yet something is amiss These must be the bestbehaved public space users in the city the movable chairs are in fact not movable or as proves the case management prohibits users from moving the movable chairs This provokes the only common user complaint Theyre very restrictive You can only turn your chair one way you cant turn it the other way    If you turn your chair the guy comes up and says no you cant take your chair from here and put it over there He says thats the rule Asked about the rule the guard explains that it makes it simpler for management to count the chairs The special permit authorizing the through block plaza requires 133 movable chairs The animating idea of a movable chair is that it allows the user to create his or her own social environment rather than compromising that environment to the fixed location of a chair Although management may impose reasonable rules of conduct in privately owned public spaces such rules should not undermine the fundamental nature and extent of a required amenity raising an interesting question in this caseNot all of the through block plaza is regimented The area surrounding the square brick water fountain and pool attracts slightly raucous densely packed crowds that bask in the sunshine as they eat and socialize A black aluminum abstract sculpture entitled Throwback 19761979 by Tony Smith appears to float on the water The surrounding ledge is barely sittable especially for women wearing skirts warns one female user but other ledges are higher and better Several additional areas offer different user experiences A narrow channel of water meanders north under and next to the arcade ultimately connecting to a small pool and waterfall where greater solitude may be found Closer to West 46th Street is a miniature forest of trees a reminder that the host office tower used to be the headquarters for the International Paper Company and this forest literally advertised its business The lunchtime concerts previously sponsored by International Paper are missed At a recent site visit the open air cafÃ© that at one time operated at the eastern side was similarly absent but the special permit requires a food concession No record of City approval for this absence has been found A ribbon of plaza that is no more than additional sidewalk wraps around the rest of the building along Sixth Avenue and West 45th and 46th Streets,-73.981851,,10196,https://apops.mas.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/2012-1166_Sixth_Ave-a-e1352214361671.jpg,40.75682,,Manhattan,3.25,"Artwork: Tony Smith sculpture in fountain, 9/11 memorial sculpture in the northerly sideBicycle Parking: 3 bike racksDrinking Fountain: 1LightingLitter Receptacles: 160 cubic feetOther Required: florist or food concession adjacent to the Through Block PlazaPlanting: 5,255 sf, 14 flower potsPlaque/Sign: 2 located on West 45th Street, 2 located on West 46th StreetSeating: 885 linear feet including 78 lf with backs, 606 lf planter seats without backs, and 134 movable chairs (201 lf)Tables: 24Trees on Street: 29Trees within Space: 35Water Feature: water fountain",POPS,Restricted

Booking in advance was not necessary. There is a restaurant on site for table service. We didn't have time for that. Wish they had a grab and go option.

"875 THIRD AVENUE, New York, NY 10022",875 Third Avenue,Four wellcoordinated public spaces join forces to invigorate this full blockfront office tower on the east side of Third Avenue between East 52nd and 53rd Streets An open space occupies the triangular area at the southeast corner of Third Avenue and East 53rd Street A public circulation space inside the building connects users from the open space to the threelevel covered pedestrian space Miniscule arcade spaces cover the entrances to the covered pedestrian space at the northeast corner of Third Avenue and East 52nd Street and on East 53rd Street east of Third AvenueOf the four the covered pedestrian space is the main attraction In some respects it is similar to the space at the Crystal Pavilion building two blocks south It operates on three levels including ground concourse and mezzanine levels It has a threestory open core that is partially enclosed by glass skylight to the northwest Its ground level serves mostly as a circulation corridor creating a shortcut from the northeast corner of Third Avenue and East 52nd Street northeast to East 53rd Street while providing access in the middle via crisscrossing bright redpaneled escalators to concourse and mezzanine levels At the concourse level eight types of food outlets purvey their wares to large lunchtime crowds seated at the plentiful movable tables and chairs A flower shop adds color and a piano stands at the ready The mezzanine level above surrounds the core and furnishes more tables and chairsThere are a number of differences however between this space and the one at Crystal Pavilion that hold important lessons for the planning and design of covered pedestrian spaces Although this one lacks Crystal Pavilions surface sizzle  indeed the redandblack color scheme seems plain by comparison  it nonetheless hosts a level of activity unseen down the street The explanations are easy to unearth To begin with this covered pedestrian space is not an end in itself Its street level is activated by the stream of employees and visitors who pass through the space to reach the private elevators of the office tower The concourse level provides access to the subway an attraction especially important for sunken spaces whether inside or outside that inevitably need something extra to generate the foot traffic Once there if there is something else to interest passersby such as food they will stop creating more activity that itself draws othersAnother difference between this covered pedestrian space and the one at Crystal Pavilion is its street face Here the interior space is not cloaked behind a typical office building entry faÃ§ade that does everything but tell passersby about the existence of something interesting inside The open space at Third Avenue and East 53rd Street was created in 1990 after several existing lowrise buildings were demolished in a second development phase By removing these structures the design initiated a salutary transparency between outdoor and indoor public experiences influencing pedestrians to pause for a moment at the movable tables and chairs in front of the cafÃ© or to enter the interior space visually evident through the glass wallSeveral other amenities are worth citing The streetlevel covered pedestrian space and public circulation space have tables chairs and adjacent food service and it is important to note that members of the public may sit without obligation to purchase anything The cafÃ© does have its own seating area however northeast of the public circulation space that it may operate as it chooses Weekly public events at least one hour in length are scheduled Two public restrooms are located at the eastern end of the concourse level behind dark glass doors that the guard must open At least two guards patrol the spacesThe operation of these spaces today stands in contrast to a bumpy early history In 1983 the City brought a court action against the building owner when it leased out two office floors representing the bonus floor area for the spaces prior to completing the spaces as described in the special permit and restrictive declaration The City and owner were able to settle the dispute,-73.969196,,10022,https://apops.mas.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/875-Third-Avenue-10.7.14-14.jpg,40.757218,,Manhattan,3.57,"Climate ControlEscalator: escalators to

It's a 3 day event and I think all 3 days is a perfect amount of time to get as much entertainment in for what's being offered here. The wide variety of food they offer is amazing from vegan options to meat eaters they seem to have everything covered. I deducted a star for the outrageous prices they charge for admission and food. Two cocktails were $36 and they were in small plastic cups loaded with ice. I had asked for no ice one time and they said that its something they could not do unless they only fill it up half. I thought that was super tacky. For the amount of money we're spending on admission which was a little over $600 for 2 adults/3 days they should have been a little bit more generous with food and drink prices.

Trump Tower,725 Fifth Avenue,The covered pedestrian space at Trump Tower is simultaneously New York Citys most famous and least understood privately owned public space Most famous because everyone has heard of it Least understood because few New Yorkers appreciate that this space is legally required to be open and accessible to the public The developer Donald Trump obtained zoning floor area bonuses in return for the covered pedestrian space and two outdoor landscaped terraces on upper floors as well as for additional retail space In short this unabashed unapologetic and by any crowd measure popular celebration of commerce is a product of public as well as private entrepreneurial espritA sign near the entrance declares Welcome to the worlds most extraordinary shopping experience And indeed hyperbole is the order of the day The interior at Trump Tower is eye candy a confection of colors layers reflections movements and glitz A doorman in uniform like that of a royal guard ushers visitors through the monumental brassglassfaÃ§ade of the Fifth Avenue entrance Red pink orange and beigeswirled marble walls and floors merge to overtake the senses In gravitys thrall visitors are pulled by the corridors downward slope past retail stores and two large goldcolored Ts to the centerpiece a sixstory skylit shopping atrium Physically encircled by overhanging balcony corridors multistory water wall and five sets of switchback escalators the atrium strenuously engages visual and aural senses Reflections and sounds bounce off the profusion of marble brass glass and mirrored surfaces People stream up and down the escalators sometimes to the point of overcrowding then peer out over shiny railings rimming the precipitous edges of the shopping floors While many of the stores seem geared to a predominantly tourist clientele the shopping ambiance even if vicarious is almost overpoweringThe covered pedestrian spaces legally required floor area occurs at both street and belowstreet concourse levels At street level in the entrance corridor across from the elevators is the first recognizable public amenity a long marble bench where people plant themselves bags askew to gain strength for further Fifth Avenue shopping or simply to relax The bench has an interesting past In 1984 an enthusiast of the space wrote a letter to Mr Trump and the Citys Department of Buildings with a copy to then Mayor Edward Koch complaining that management had placed plants and flowers on the bench thereby obstructing sitting The plants and flowers were subsequently removedAt concourse level at the base of the atrium are numerous movable tables and chairs tightly packed on a slightly elevated platform next to the water wall In the past nearby food outlets have indulged in episodes of cafÃ© creep spilling out into the covered pedestrian space It is important to recognize that members of the public may sit at any of these tables and chairs without obligation to purchase anything Public restrooms are located at the end of a corridor leading from the southwest corner of the spaceThe two outdoor landscaped terraces on upper levels require a degree of perseverance to find especially because signage on the street floor where most of the public initially gathers is meager Reachable by one of the elevators off the Fifth Avenue entrance corridor or by escalators the fourth floor terrace at the southeast corner of the atrium is a petite garden space with trees planters comfortable polished granite ledge seating and birdseye views of the iconic postmodern Sony building designed by Philip Johnson to the east and Fifth Avenue to the west The recently renovated and more ambitious landscaped terrace on the north side of the fifth floor is currently less used than its fourth floor counterpart an irony in that the space is not only more capacious and better appointed but it is also more easily reached whether by escalator by Trump elevator off the Fifth Avenue entrance corridor by Niketown elevator from street level near the northeast corner of the covered pedestrian space or from the top floor of Niketown itself Signs at and within the multiple entries unfortunately tend to confuse referring to the Public Garden the Roof Terrace a location on the fifth floor and a location on the sixth floor In fact the landscaped terrace is on Trumps fifth floor and Niketowns sixth floorWhatever it is called the space is an extremely pleasant rectangular roof garden extending to a view of East 57th Street The street scene is visible though five huge picture windows crowned with four American flags loosely evoking the New York impressionist paintings of Childe Hassam A bluetinged pool with fountains is flanked by fixed metal benches on one side and nine large trees on the other Stylish movable silver tables and chairs are distributed throughout and nearest East 57th Street is an elevated sliver with additional tables and chairs and a secluded corner The only thing missing is the usersA passageway connects the Trump covered pedestrian space to the indoor spaces at 590 Madison Avenue to the east Although this marriage of spaces is the Citys only example of connected indoor public spaces uninterrupted by a street it is hardly a union of like personalities To the benefit of both the formers commercial exuberance is nicely counterbalanced by the latters tranquillity A third covered pedestrian space at the Sony building across East 56th Street from 590 Madison Avenue makes this area a highdensity showcase for indoor public

For some reason the city decided to focus on the building being beneficial to the environment and a modern design then actual being a library.  The grass on the roof is an interesting touch but you know what I would rather? A larger book selection, a separate quite room for studying, staff that don't seem to loath you for having the gall to take out a few books. Just not impressed with this library and the small selection of books spread out across the half empty shelves. Its also quite amusing that a worker of this branch gives here branch 5 stars as if she isn't completely biased. Also this worker claims that even though we have a ""negative perception "" (read that as ""legitimate complaints"") of the library, we should just be happy we have a library at all. Are you kidding me? Your response to people complaining about the library's service is ""we are awesome, just be happy you have a library."" Instead of lecturing us to be more thankful for the lackluster performance from a library branch that took 4 years and 10 million dollars to build, how about actually addressing the problems visitors have? If the city can spend 10 million dollars on the building and pay workers a salary to ignore the fact I'm waiting to check out books, the city should be able to fill the empty selves and employee workers who care about the visitors in this glorified greenhouse. Also Its nice that the library ""cares"" but if I don't see this ""care"" then it doesn't really help me if you claim its there. Also you can claim you ""know for a fact employees go out of their way to help"" but some of the people who come to the library don't feel that way. I was going to give the library 2 stars but because of the tone-deafness of the employee's review it has to be a single star. /AUTHOR: RRR /RATING: 3 /TEXT: Stopped by because it was conveniently open on a Sunday. The building was recently renovated (haven't been here before that). It is aesthetically pleasing and airy. There's a large selection of books, DVD's and seating.

Parking in surrounding area is very difficult. /AUTHOR: Susan Paredes /RATING: 5 /TEXT: Working as the current branch Manager for Kew Gardens Hills has been a privilege for me. Having worked for Queens library for over 12 years  I see the hard work our staff,   throughout the whole borough of Queens in general, provide services for our community. They go out of their ways to assist patrons on immigration paper to simply assisting patrons assigning them on the computer. I know for a fact we go beyond our ways to assist patrons  needs. I don't think there's anyone in Queens who is not fit to work at our organization not caring about people. Its what we do on a daily basis. That's why we are all fortunate to be working in this organization. We should all be grateful that the City of NYC supports libraries no matter what conditions the buildings is in ; Its the people who matter most and who we try our best to please them with our on going service. I've been in countries where there is no libraries and people struggle with poverty and illiteracy. We should be thankful that this country especially Queens Library gives us the opportunity to be successful whether its having access to the internet or attending to a job business academy, we have a chance to be somebody successful.  For those that have a negative impression about Queens library, think about how fortunate we are to at least have a library that cares. /AUTHOR: Nami Hrd /RATING: 1 /TEXT: I honestly agree with most of the negative comments. The area for the kids/toddlers is also claustrophobic and it's hard for moms and nannies to be able to be with kids in such a miniscule area. It all just feels so closed in and walk room just feels like you would bump into someone randomly so easily. I honestly was excited for the opening of the library only to be let down by a tiny kids area, tiny study table area where there happens to be a book shelf just behind the chairs there so people at the table need to constantly get out of their chair or squeeze themselves against the table in order to allow people get to the books, tiny walkways between bookshelves that can be daunting to just pass through, ridiculous opening hours(seriously opening so late is just upsetting) and a very snarky employee who has a habit of acting like they like shaming people. (Coming from a personal experience.) Things need to be fixed and for goodness sakes, please find a way to have the mommies and nannies park their strollers in a safe and secure area. (Outside the library would be an insecure area in case you think of it. People love stealing from strollers.)  N.B: Also in response to that one worker who essentially said we should just be glad we have a library, just know I also travelled and have been to some badly off areas where they have a better organized library than this. All we ask is for proper structure in the library. It is a nice library but things need to be a bit more reasonable in there. /AUTHOR: Monbebe Forever /RATING: 3 /TEXT: The library looks nice but the selection is not that good!

Barclays Bank,75 Wall Street,Although the building has chosen unsurprisingly to use Wall Street for its address and primary entrance its 360degree fullperimeter arcade provides easy protected passage to the highly usable throughblock urban plaza connecting Water and Pearl Streets at its rear The urban plaza is a large rectangular space fashioned primarily of red brick that slowly negotiates the grade change from Water Street up to Pearl Street With their relative maturity generous canopy and open understory the numerous trees create one of the most naturalistic ambiances of the downtown public spaces The area nearest Water Street has four planters made of brick bases and granite slab ledge tops each with a single tree and a ground cover of colorful annuals The combination of brick and granite is an adept design choice making it appear that the planter emerges holistically from the sweeping brick surface of the plaza while providing users with the smoother granite ledge for sitting Unfortunately that sittable ledge is marred by narrow bisecting metal strips designed to prevent users from lying down It also means that any user must look carefully before sitting lest he or she land on one of the metal stripsWater walls and pools line the southwest edge of the urban plaza Although they seem too detached from the rest of the space they have the consequent virtue of creating something of a refuge for those seeking privacy The detachment and subsequent privacy are enhanced by a substantial and curious brick structure looking like one side of a colonnade that tracks the western side of the space from Water to Pearl Street and provides visual definition to the access ramp for the physically disabledThe remaining twothirds of plaza is largely covered by a planted area filled with birch trees whose tops are sprinkled from time to time with sunlight The planted area is surrounded on all sides by the twotoned sittable ledges including a semicircular cutout in the middle supplying three levels of ledges on which to sit and stare back at Water Street When provided the 16 movable chairs leaven the locational rigidity of ledges and allow users to customize their social arrangementsAs for the arcade it is one of several that more or less fully encircle the bases of their host towers The arcades at Goldman Sachs and 17 State Street are other examples NonBonused Public Open Space is indivisibly provided as part of the urban plaza and arcade,-74.008119,,10005,https://apops.mas.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/75-Wall-St.jpg,40.705041,,Manhattan,2.5,"Bicycle Parking: Urban PlazaPlanting: Urban PlazaPlaque/Sign: Urban PlazaSeating: Urban Plaza: 181.6 linear feet including 9 lf with backs required, 207.44 lf including 83 lf with backs provided; 16 movable seatsSeating: 28 public chairs, 40 cafe chairs permittedTables: 7 public tables, 10 cafe tables permittedTrees on Street: 19Trees within Space: Urban Plaza: 18Water Feature: Urban Plaza: fountain",POPS,24

HarperCollins,10 East 53 Street,Several steps east of Fifth Avenue and running parallel between East 52nd and 53rd Streets the HarperCollins through block arcade distinguishes itself as much for what it connects as for what it is Facing the arcade across East 53rd Street is Paley Park one of the citys treasured privately owned private spaces open to the public through the goodwill of its owner South across East 52nd Street is the entrance to Olympic Towers throughblock covered pedestrian space Together the HarperCollins and Olympic Tower public spaces forge a twoblock protected passageway making possible a direct pilgrimage between Saint Patricks Cathedral and Paley ParkAs for the through block arcade itself it serves its purpose of pedestrian connection well At East 53rd Street a black cylindrical totem announces a beginning or terminus Unenclosed at both ends the twostory corridor is designed for movement with capacious width few retail distractions and no obstructions Like milestones black rectangular columns on white stone walls rhythmically mark the journeys progress Long rows of theatrical lighting above gently guide users north or south and generate necessary illumination Small plaza spaces occupy the buildings setbacks at both East 52nd and 53rd Street entrances and provide planters with evergreen bushes and on East 52nd Street a sittable ledgeBecause Paley Park is not a legally required privately owned public space as that term is used in this book it lacks its own profile Its proximity to the HarperCollins space however provides a geographical hook if not a convenient excuse to remedy that exclusion Designed by the noted landscape architectural firm of Zion  Breen and named for Samuel Paley by his son the CBS executive William Paley who created the space Paley Park opened on May 23 1967 and has since become a model for how philanthropy and design can produce a peerless public spaceThe 4200squarefoot park roughly 42 feet by 100 feet eases its rectangular geometry through a sublime blend of natural and synthetic materials textures colors and sounds The park notifies passersby of its presence through strategic placement of trees planters filled with brightly colored flowers and special paving on the sidewalk Up four steps through a narrowed entrance is ordered nature a modernist landscape As a standalone space unconnected to a bonused building and the stream of workers or residents in and outa vestpocket park without the suit the space can focus on its singular mission of serenity contemplation and renewalThe ground is paved not with terrazzo or concrete but with roughhewn stone tiles The 17 trees spaced at 12foot intervals grow out of the surface and are tall enough that their understory sustains an open air feeling while their canopies block out looming skyscrapers Planters overflow with flowers Ivycovered brownbrick walls protectively envelop the space and exclude winds that bedevil so many plazas Scattered generously throughout are movable Bertoia wiremesh chairs Bird Chair by Harry Bertoia 19501952 and movable tables A food kiosk at the southeast corner gatehouse sells light refreshment while the gatehouse at the southwest corner shelters mechanical equipment for park maintenance activitiesAt back is the wondrous and accessible rockfaced 20foot waterfall If Paley Parks visual cues have not removed the intensity of the city then the whooshing water noise and spray will complete the job Water does not trickle down it pours down hits a level and then pours down some more into a pool According to the park superintendent a 50horsepower pump pushes a recirculated 1800 gallons per minute uphill for its downward journey Only in January is the waterfall drained and turned off Otherwise on cold days the water is heated by a steam turbine before it is pumpedPaley Parks quality is confirmed by its unusual quantity and mix of users In addition to the regulars who work or live nearby are the accidental or intentional tourists On any given day the roster might include random visitors from New Jersey or Japan as well as landscape architects and designers making the educational journey At last check the space maintained hours from 800 am to 1000 pm May 1 through November 1 and from 800 am to 800 pm November 2 through April 30Is there a lesson here The subtext of the plaque near the entrance subtly implies one This park is set aside in memory of Samuel Paley 18751963 for the enjoyment of the public No sign announces that the space is required by law to be open to the public No zoning design standards were mandated and no zoning bonus was given Like the outdoor spaces at Rockefeller Center the 6360squarefoot Greenacre Park on the north side of East 51st Street between Second and Third Avenues or the Ford Foundation building atrium on the north side of East 42nd Street between First and Second Avenues Paley Park is a product of a private owners sense of civic philanthropy interest in urban design and understanding of wise stewardship Paley took highvalue land that would normally accommodate a revenueearning building and made way for a park He hired a top landscape architect Robert Zion who had for years promoted the idea of parklets substantially smaller than the City Parks Departments then prevailing notion that three acres was the minimum acceptable park size to design the space He and his wife created and funded the position of a fulltime park superintendent and associated maintenance personnel According to one of the recent superintendents the two visited the space regularly and Mrs Paleys morning stop included instructions about which flowers to plant each month In short zoning incentives and legal requirements are helpful but not always sufficient for the task of creating excellence in public spacesPaley Parks influence extends well beyond its borders In New York City and elsewhere around the country many urban outdoor spaces borrow design features from the park Some New York spaces have substantially modeled themselves on Paley Park including for example the nearby spaces at 520 Madison Avenue and 535 Madison Avenue and the park

Le Parker Meridien Hotel,118 West 57 Street,Tensions between public and private uses reverberate throughout this elegant through block arcade connecting West 56th and 57th Streets between Sixth and Seventh Avenues While some buildings disown their public space by segregating it geographically and administratively from the private entrances and activities this private hotel by design and management has so masterfully integrated the though block arcade into its own functional orbit that it is difficult to tell where private ends and public begins Like a tuning fork the basic layout includes two legs from West 56th Street converging midblock at a threestory atrium and a single corridor stretching north from the atrium to West 57th Street The blurring of private and public is especially pronounced in the western leg entered from West 56th Street past a strip of plaza Here the through block arcade literally doubles as the hotel lobby complete with checkin desk and support services It would be impossible for any member of the public to discern that this is part of the public space without being told as here that it is At least the doorway to the eastern leg off West 56th Street is identified on its glass window as an entrance to public spaceInside here is a richly trimmed twostory corridor featuring polished patterned marble floor and walls of pastel pink and beige columns arches and mirrors Seating that appears disappears and reappears in this corridor has led to a series of legal disputes between the City and building owner The 1979 special permit requiring the through block arcade also mandated 54 movable chairs and 18 movable tables allocated to this corridor and the midblock atrium by plans approved as part of the special permit action In 1991 following reported thefts from hotel guests that the owner attributed to perpetrators using the chairs the owner applied to the City Planning Commission to reduce the amount and change the configuration of required seating Although the application was never completed the owner nonetheless removed the chairsVisitors to the space who enjoyed the chairs including dancers from the Joffrey Ballet who rehearsed nearby were unhappy On October 13 1992 the Citys Department of Buildings issued a notice of violation for failure to maintain the movable chairs in this part of the through block arcade An administrative law judge dismissed the notice on January 21 1993 finding that the chairs were not a point of emphasis in the original 1979 special permit and that the chairs did not serve what he understood as the essential purpose of substantially improved pedestrian circulation On appeal the Citys Environmental Control Board reversed concluding that the chairs did indeed provide an important amenity and that there was no proof that seating was an insignificant part of the conditions set forth in the special permit The owner was fined 475 for its violation of the Zoning Resolution The owner next brought its own action in a New York state trial court claiming that the decision of the Environmental Control Board was arbitrary and capricious and requesting that the decision be annulled On October 7 1994 the state court judge dismissed the owners petition and upheld the Boards determinationThe legal saga did not end there however Shortly after the judges decision the Buildings Department filed another notice of violation for failure to provide required chairs and tables This time an administrative law judge on April 11 1995 concluded that the apparently reduced number of movable chairs benches and a desk present at the time of the latest Buildings Department inspection were in substantial compliance with the original 1979 special permitThe owner has recently stated that the chairs have been replaced with eight benches accommodating twotothree people each and twelve additional chairs five tables and a desk Recent site visits have confirmed this

They didn't have anything for a month out which seemed excessive, but I decided to make it anyway. Then, they ask me to give my CC info over text, which I don't feel comfortable doing since I have no idea who or what I'm texting and I already paid for the Groupon. I try calling to give it over the phone since they insisted, but no answer. Try calling the next day, no answer. Do this for 5 days and finally text them to say I've been trying to call and so they call me and tell me they were on the other line. Lie...were they really on the other line 4 days in a row? Sure. So then they say they ""reviewed our conversation"" and would like to let me know that unfortunately despite my upcoming appointment, one of their machines is broken so they have to move my appointment and ask if a month later is ok. A MONTH. Apparently they only have 2 machines and one can only be used by one technician so there's nothing they can do. No new machine, no fixing the broken one, no having someone ELSE just use the one they have to open up appointments. No thank you. Asking Groupon for my money back and spending it elsewhere. Somewhere with better customer service and work ethic.

There is a running trail from Hylan to the beach, with clear markers on miles.  There are several sandy beaches.  Nicely built marina with paved paths and picturesque docks.

1 Exchange Plaza,55 Broadway,Three of the four public spaces at 55 Broadway were mandated by the recently repealed Special Greenwich Street Development District a special purpose zoning district enacted in 1971 to implement an ambitious plan for pedestrian improvements within a 24block area of lower Manhattan bounded by Broadway to the east the World Trade Center complex to the north Battery Park City to the west and Battery Park to the south Unlike traditional zoning districts that declare general rules applying uniformly to all lots within the district the Special Greenwich Street district mapped specific unique mandatory and elective pedestrian circulation and lot improvements blockbyblock requiring or encouraging future developments on such blocks to provide such features The final result was to be an innovative multilevel pedestrian circulation system facilitating movement shopping subway access and enjoyment of open space in the face of an increasingly dense downtownThe greatest danger to this type of zoning is that the real estate market will not cooperate that development will not occur as expected and that the plan thus will be implemented in a piecemeal fashion that fails to accomplish its overall goals Such was the fate of the Special Greenwich Street Development District zoning plan For the lot now occupied by 55 Broadway for example the Special Greenwich Street plan required an enclosed pedestrian bridge spanning Trinity Place easttowest an elevated shopping way some 22 feet above and parallel to Trinity Place a pedestrian connection from that elevated shopping way to Broadway paralleling Exchange Alley and an arcade along Broadway When private development on the other side of Trinity Place did not occur as anticipated the zoning requirement for the enclosed pedestrian bridge was dropped before the bridge was ever constructedThe four legal types of public space that do exist at 55 Broadway were provided to some degree on the assumption that an upperlevel pedestrian network would be constructed Together the four spaces forge a pathway between Broadway and Trinity Place that duplicates the downwardsloping Exchange Alley immediately adjacent to the north Beginning next to the intersection of Broadway and Exchange Alley the narrow urban plaza squeezes pedestrians between the steps leading from the Alley and the arcade under the pianoshaped building edge to the south Further west four round treefilled planters on one side and banded arcade columns on the other flank a chutelike corridor of increasingly narrow width The covered loggia supplies escalators to navigate the substantial grade change down to the lowerlevel retail shopping arcade beyond which is Trinity Place Without the enclosed pedestrian bridge however the loggia now would have no reason to connect pedestrians to an upperlevel elevated shopping way directly above the existing lowerlevel shopping arcade along Trinity Place that were together known as a shopping way and had been required by the Special Greenwich Street Development District zoning Thus like the bridge the elevated shopping way component of the shopping way was dropped by the City in 1992 That effectively ended the hopes for an upperlevel network that would also connect to 45 Broadways similarly mapped but similarly never implemented elevated shopping way along Trinity Place to the southBy comparison another Special Greenwich Street Development District pedestrian improvement amenity suffered an unhappier fate A mandatory open pedestrian bridge spanning Greenwich Street between One Bankers Trust Plaza and a Cityowned lowrise building was actually constructed Unfortunately contrary to expectations the existing lowrise building that housed a City fire station and a fast food restaurant was never replaced by the anticipated new office tower that would justify the bridge After years of carrying no meaningful foot traffic the bridge was recently demolishedEven without the upperlevel network three reasons explain why a pedestrian might choose the 55 Broadway pathway over the adjacent Exchange Alley First much of it is covered Second it is level for much of its run and allows escalators rather than the slope of Exchange Alley to facilitate the descent or ascent Third planter ledges and a movable seating unit that was missing at a recent site visit furnish seating for the momentary stops that pedestrians like to make A recent site visit also revealed cafÃ© tables and chairs arrayed in the shopping arcade along Trinity Place No record of City approval for this use has been found,-74.013024,,10006,https://apops.mas.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/55-broadway-e1350281998912.jpg,40.706855,,Manhattan,,"Escalator: Pair of escalators on

They have plenty of swings and 3 play structures - 2 for smaller kids so you don't have to worry about the bigger kids running over them. In the mornings, the little kid swings are often hogged by nannies on cellphones who keep their little charges in the swings for a long time, so you may need  to wait. There are plenty of benches and half if it is usually shaded. I only come here in the mornings and afternoons, but it feels safe because Amsterdam has so much foot traffic and the police station is next to the playground.

Carlton Towers,200 East 64 Street,The story behind this privately owned public space at the southeast corner of Third Avenue and East 64th Street begins unhappily but ends better When the host building and plaza were initially constructed a small structure occupied by a restaurant was erected on a substantial portion of the required plaza along Third Avenue When the City eventually learned about this encroachment its Department of City Planning and Department of Buildings together with its Board of Standards and Appeals BSA devised a plan that would allow the restaurant to remain in return for the provision of additional plaza elsewhere on the Third Avenue side and amenities otherwise not required for asofright plazas The plan was memorialized in a BSA varianceWhere the plaza had previously included a small strip of sunken space several steps below the Third Avenue sidewalk in front of retail stores that was of negligible value the new design would move the stores forward to the Third Avenue lot line and construct elevated space above the stores otherwise prohibited by the asofright plazas prohibition against space more than five feet above curb level The variance required extensive landscaping and seating as well as a television surveillance camera The owner would be allowed to close the elevated space from midnight until 600 am dailyThe resulting plaza is certainly superior to the strip plazas churned out by many developers during the 1960s and early 1970s The elevated plaza may be entered up steps from East 64th Street east of Third Avenue or up a narrow stairwell from Third Avenue midway between East 63rd and 64th Streets squeezed between the restaurant and a garage driveway At a recent site visit this stairwell entrance was locked with no record of City approval for this action Inside the East 64th Street entrance is a small area on top of the stores featuring three woodenslat benches with backs and planters The main part of the space is several steps below to the east behind the store and restaurant almost too secluded from the street given security anxieties especially in an elevated space The tall encircling white wood planters filled with shrubbery and flowers oddly evoke the feeling of a residential condominium deck near the beach More woodenslat benches with and without backs provide seating The remaining plaza space on East 64th Street is in front of the main entrance to the residential building and hasÂ several plantersÂ ,-73.964081,,10065,https://apops.mas.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/200-East-64th-Street-Carlton-Towers-standin.jpg,40.764339,,Manhattan,3,LightingLitter ReceptaclesPlanting: arbor and extensive landscaping in elevated portion of PlazaPlaque/SignSeating: 15 benches totaling 90 linear feet including 22 lf with backs in elevated portion of Plaza,POPS,Restricted

Sony,550 Madison Avenue,When the ATT Building designed by Philip Johnson and John Burgee first enrolled in Manhattans skyline in 1983 most of the attention focused on its splitpediment Chippendale top and its postmodern iconic meaning Roughly ten years later however when ownership of the building shifted from ATT to the Sony Corporation the focus shifted downward That is because in 1992 Sony applied to the City Planning Commission for permission to pack Sony retail store space into most of the 60foottall openair arcade encircling the building on the west side of Madison Avenue and on East 55th and 56th Streets The proposal bluntly raised the question when if ever privatization of public space should be formally allowedSpecifically Sony proposed to eliminate 10560 square feet of arcade reducing it from 14102 to 3542 square feet and to replace it with 6050 square feet of indoor retail space much of it along the Madison Avenue frontage Were this all to the proposal the answer would be easy since Sony not only would be decreasing public space but would also be increasing private floor area What made this a matter for legitimate public debate was Sonys sweetener its offer to enlarge its covered pedestrian space located at the rear of the building and connecting East 55th and 56th Streets from 5625 square feet to 9731 square feet and to render it climate controlled Sony was offering an additional 4106 square feet of covered pedestrian space and a general enhancement of its qualities in exchange for a reduction of 10560 square feet of asofright arcade Sony also proposed to eliminate 1324 square feet of retail space fronting the covered pedestrian space and to replace the ATT Infoquest Center with its own exhibit center called SonyWonder Technology Lab in the annexThe zoning arithmetic worked out as follows Reflecting the judgment that square foot for square foot a covered pedestrian space is more valuable to the public and more expensive to construct than an arcade the Zoning Resolution generally authorized a substantially greater bonus per square foot of covered pedestrian space In the Sony case at a rate of 11 square feet of bonus floor area for every square foot of covered pedestrian space the additional covered pedestrian space would generate a bonus of 45166 square feet At a rate of three square feet of bonus floor area for every square foot of arcade the lost 10560 square feet of arcade would reduce the buildings zoning floor area entitlement by 31680 square feet Thus even after Sony would have constructed 6050 square feet of new retail space in the old arcade space that would still leave it with an unused entitlement of more than 7000 square feet of building And that would be before counting the 1324 square foot reduction of retail space in the covered pedestrian space In short in the arcane world of zoning bonuses for privately owned public spaces it could be argued the public would emerge more than whole with less but more valuable public space The City agreed with this reasoning and approved Sonys application in 1992 concluding that the public benefit associated with the changes exceeded the public benefit associated with the existing configurationTodays covered pedestrian space an impressive glasscovered threestory throughblock corridor may be entered from East 55th or 56th Streets under the remaining portion of outdoor arcade left over from the original design or through the 80foothigh granite entry arch and intensely vertical private lobby of the Sony building from Madison Avenue Enclosed above by a halfbarrel vaulted glass ceiling supported by white metal lattice and transverse white industrial beams and at both ends by glass the space is light and airy Indeed in physical form it comes the closest of any throughblock privately owned public space in the city toward evoking the nineteenthcentury European arcade with Connecticut granite for the patterned floor and columns even if the half vault and squeezed corridor evoke half an arcade and recent intrusions including a large frame with light bulbs hanging from the ceiling and bumpout windows from the sides clutter the air The spaces overall transparency and axis create a convincing visual as well as functional engagement with 590 Madison Avenues glassenclosed through block arcade and covered pedestrian space to the north forging two blocks of protected midblock passage as well as access through Trump Tower to Fifth AvenueFueled partly by the SonyWonder Technology Lab partly by food and retail offerings and partly by its highly functional amenities for passive activities the space receives heavy use Groups of schoolchildren noisily queue up at and near the Sony exhibit located in an annex at the northern end alternately amused and perplexed by a mechanical barker equipped with live actors voice that interacts conversationally Numerous silver metal movable tables and chairs the same type as those used at 590 Madison and part of Trump are collected principally in the two anterooms located off both ends of the through block passage Here office workers shoppers tourists and other individuals avoid the commotion of the linear corridor as they enjoy typical public space activities of eating reading talking and resting Additional chairs and tables line the corridor and the space has abjured the doubleloaded retail layout of a shopping mall for most of its length A destination restaurant joins convenience retail on the western side and users with long memories and deep pockets might recall the Quilted Giraffe one of the citys most famous and expensive restaurants Public restrooms are available at the SonyWonder annexAs for the lost arcade spaces it would be a mistake to romanticize them During much of the year they were cold dark and windy They were most usable during the dog days of summer when their high vaulted ceilings and heavy granite arches and columns psychologically if not physically fostered coolness much the way the dark mysterious interiors of cathedrals have done for centuries Remaining arcade space still lines East 55th and 56th Street sides of the building

Tribeca Tower,105 Duane Street,When the City Planning Commission introduced new zoning rules for plazas at residential buildings in 1977 that made southern exposures the location of first priority it could have been thinking presciently about the development of this zoning lot The lot runs throughblock between Duane and Thomas Streets west of Broadway and under the original 1961 zoning plaza standards a plaza could have been situated at the northern front on Thomas Street In that case much of the space would have been in the shade with usage seriously diminished Instead while the Thomas Street side has a strip of visual residual space the primary space of this residential plaza luxuriates in sunlight for much of the day along Duane StreetIndeed if there is such a thing as too much sun this space has it With its abundant brick surfaces both absorbing and reflecting the suns rays liquid refreshment and sunglasses become a necessity during cloudless summer days The plentiful ledge seating and fixed metal chairs certainly accommodate neighborhood users of the space although it would be even better if it were possible to move seating to the few spots where shade is available While the landscaping arrayed on cascading terraces at back is pleasant to look at it would be enjoyed even more were it liberally sprinkled throughoutAs downtown Manhattans only residential plaza the space naturally exudes a different character than spaces at office towers Its design unabashedly embraces the virtues of intimacy and smallness yet never turns its back on the street or its host building The plaza edge along Duane Street is skillfully rendered partly shielded by fixed planters and partly open for easy entrance and exit Although some plazas are better served by isolating much or all of themselves from the surrounding area this one correctly recognizes the salutary aspects of permeability at this location Duane Street offers interesting views especially of a fire station directly across the street with its colorful trucks and firefighters A food shop is ready to supply sandwiches for the lunchtime crowdThe glasscanopied entrance pathway to the towers front door is off to the side nearer Broadway but it never shuns the plaza providing an opening near the lobby door frequently used by tower residents as they head west Residents and outside members of the public are thus in regular contact at least in passing Put simply this is one of the best examples of a neighborhood space in downtown Manhattan,-74.00601,,10007,https://apops.mas.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/105-Duane-Street-Tribeca-Tower.jpg,40.715743,,Manhattan,3.5,"Bicycle Parking: Primary Space: 18 spacesDrinking Fountain: Primary Space: 1Litter ReceptaclesPlanting: Primary Space, Visual Residual SpacePlaque/SignSeating: Primary Space: 300 linear feet including 33 lf with backsTrees on StreetTrees within Space: 13",POPS,24

10 Hanover Square,86 Water Street,The most interesting fact here has nothing to do with the extant public space a small plaza facing Hanover Square between Water and Pearl Streets renovated several years ago and principally composed of a languidly curving series of steps leading to a small terrace in front of the main entrance The public space that interests is one no longer in existence a tiny arcade on Pearl Street now fully subsumed by the building as part of a ground floor renovation Although that arcade generated a 31 floor area bonus of 2007 square feet from its 669squarefoot size the building as actually built not only did not utilize that bonus floor area but had enough of a zoning floor area cushion that it could actually increase its total built floor area by the 669 square feet created by enclosing the arcade into the building square footage without exceeding the maximum allowable zoning floor area for the lot Thus the arcade legally changed its identity from required privately owned public space to private spaceThe plazas situation on Hanover Square faces an historic part of the city The square itself was the location of the citys first printing press established in 1692 by the Philadelphia printer William Bradford at 81 Pearl Street as well as the home in the late 1600s to the pirate Captain Kidd who was later hanged in England The nearby statue is of Abraham de Peyster the citys mayor from 1691 to 1695 Between 1851 and 1854 the ornate Italianatestyle India House was completed to provide space for a bank and was subsequently used for a cotton exchange a corporation and a private clubAt a recent site visit the plaza appeared to be under construction scaffoldingÂ Â ,-74.008858,,10005,https://apops.mas.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/86-Water-Street.jpg,40.704569,,Manhattan,1,No required amenities,POPS,24

PaineWebber,1285 Sixth Avenue,Public spaces at PaineWebber reflect lessons learned from the indiscriminate provision of huge setback plazas on the west side of Sixth Avenue during the late 1960s and early 1970s Under the original provisions of the 1961 Zoning Resolution the PaineWebber building would have been able to construct asofright a 24000squarefoot plaza on Sixth Avenue that would have generated almost a quartermillion square feet of bonus floor area like the plazas in front of 1251 Sixth Avenue McGrawHill and 1211 Sixth Avenue to the south What may have worked on an individual lot however became problematic when replicated in series Nurtured by building street wall continuity retail frontage bounded public sidewalks and density of pedestrian traffic the avenues urban vitality was disturbed when the three plazas appeared next to one another For some this was the end of Sixth Avenues aspiration to great street status Zoning amendments in 1975 and 1981 effectively prohibited such asofright plazas along Sixth Avenue by inaugurating new design standards including requirements for amenities and a City Planning Commission Chairpersons review process known as certification The day of massive plazas fronting office towers on Sixth Avenue was over and a new dawn of urban plazas arrivedThe PaineWebber urban plaza is a fine example of the new approach To begin with the space is not even located in front of the building which is barely set back from the west side of Sixth Avenue Instead the buildings south and north sides extending west from Sixth Avenue along West 51st and 52nd Streets are recessed to accommodate mirrorimage rectangular plaza areas totaling slightly less than 10000 square feet Sculptor Scott Burton created two works for these areas conveniently entitled Urban Plaza South and Urban Plaza North 198586 In the south plaza area he installed three rows of fixed granite tables surrounded by three granite stools each that sprawl under the edge of the adjacent arcade In form and layout they suggest an archaeological find as if some ancient religious order rather than public art virtuoso had dictated their design and placement Two large triangular granite planters with bushes and builtin benches interpose a transitional zone between Sixth Avenue and the stone seats and tables In the north plaza area a reverse of the layout is attempted with a series of angular polished granite benches closer to Sixth Avenue and triangular planters located at backAn outdoor partially skylit through block galleria connects West 51st and 52nd Streets midblock between Sixth and Seventh Avenues at the back of the building With its sculptures wall murals of geometric patterns water pool and polished granite ledge seating and benches the space serves destination as well as circulation ends something expressly contemplated by the zoning standards for through block gallerias in contrast to the solitary circulation focus of through block connections The amusing bronze sculptures created by Barry Flanagan at each end are entitled Hare on Bell 1983 and Young Elephant 1984 and an elegant glassandgoldcolored structure houses escalators that lead to the concourse level of the Rockefeller Center complex and the subwayAs the inaugural link in the Citys longest most successful midblock pedestrian network a sixblock chain linking West 51st to 57th Streets the space makes its mark People love secret passageways those alternative ways to get from point A to point B often discovered by happenstance From a design perspective this type of midblock passageway finds its conceptual origins in the elaborate shopping arcades of eighteenth and nineteenth century European cities Covered shopping arcades appeared in Paris at the end of the eighteenth century as alternatives to the chaotic and before Baron Haussmanns midnineteenth century interventions cramped Parisian streets London introduced its own version of the shopping arcade in the nineteenth century culminating in a number of graceful soaring confections of glass iron and terracottaAs a matter of zoning policy the Citys ambition would be less extravagant Simple midblock shortcuts would be bonused or required especially in the Special Midtown Districts designated corridor between Sixth and Seventh Avenues as a means of easing the pedestrians burden along the lengthy avenuetoavenue span and as a means of reducing sidewalk congestion Knowing the difficulty of creating financially sustainable interior retail spaces retail frontage would not necessarily be mandated especially when no zoning bonus was granted Fully indoor spaces would not necessarily be preferred when covered outdoor corridors would perform adequatelyThis space links West 51st Street to the through block galleria at Flatotel connecting West 52nd and 53rd Streets the through block galleria at 1325 Avenue of the AmericasÂ between West 53rd and 54th Streets the through block connection at Rihga Royal Hotel between West 54th and 55th Streets the through block connection at CitySpire between West 55th and 56th Streets and principally but not exclusively the through block connection at Metropolitan Tower As discussed in the profile of the through block connection at Metropolitan Tower there are two other choices for reaching West 57th Street from West 56th Street without setting foot on or straying outside the boundaries of Sixth or Seventh Avenues including the through block arcade at Le Parker Meridian Hotel and the through block connection at Carnegie Hall TowerThere are five other midblock pedestrian networks fabricated from privately owned public spaces in the city A fourblock chain connects West 44th Street to 48th Streets and is described in the profile for Millennium Broadway The others are each two blocks long connecting East 48th to 50th Streets between Madison and Fifth Avenue as described in the profile of Tower 49 connecting East 51st and 53rd Streets between Madison and Fifth Avenues as described in the profile of Olympic Tower connecting East 55th to 57th Streets between Madison and Fifth Avenues as described in the profile of Sony and connecting West 44th to 46th between Broadway and Eighth Avenues as described in the profile of One Astor PlaceThe City has also encouraged the creation of subterranean and abovestreetlevel pedestrian networks For example a number of office buildings for example Paramount Plaza have received floor area bonuses to provide streetlevel access and belowground concourses linking to the subway system Downtown efforts such as the recently repealed Special Greenwich Street Development District south of the World Trade Center and its secondlevel pedestrian bridges have met with mixed results as described in the profile of One Bankers Trust PlazaThe through block galleria here marks the physical dividing line between the PaineWebber building and the Equitable Center Designed by different architects  Skidmore Owings  Merrill designed PaineWebber Edward Larrabee Barnes designed Equitable  and developed separately in two phases the buildings together offer an incredible array of art in their indoor privately owned lobbies that are nonetheless voluntarily opened to public visitation In the monumental lobby of the Equitable Center for example is Thomas Hart Bentons America Today 1930 a tenpanel Works Progress Administration tempera on linen that depicts American life and social conditions of the 1920s A huge Roy Lichtenstein work entitled Mural with Blue Brushstroke 198485 was commissioned for this space The PaineWebber Gallery has its own rotating collection of compelling artworks The sidewalk widening pedestrian circulation space along much of West 51st and 52nd Streets

"575 FIFTH AVENUE, New York, NY 10017",575 Fifth Avenue,I think its beautiful Im really overwhelmed    I didnt expect this says one middleaged woman visiting this covered pedestrian space and its fourstory atrium at the southeast corner of Fifth Avenue and East 47th Street for the first time That is a common reaction among most firsttime users who stumble upon it and wonder why they had not known of it beforeThe space is a smaller less glitzy rendition of Trump Towers covered pedestrian space 10 blocks north with similar materials color palette and crisscrossing escalators But that is where the similarity ends While Trump Tower is a triumph of marketing making it one of the must see places along with the Empire State Building and the Statue of Liberty on a typical tourist itinerary 575 Fifth has yet to be discovered even by resident New Yorkers who would greatly value its quiet demeanor and uncrowded atmosphereThe modest entrances off the east side of Fifth Avenue or East 47th Street through arcade spaces hardly foreshadow the scene inside Down a short corridor from the Fifth Avenue entrance one unexpectedly encounters the part postmodern part art deco part streamlined moderne fourlevel atrium The streetlevel corridors surrounding the atrium core and the full concourse level below constitute the required square footage of the covered pedestrian space The public area includes the second floor corridors Polished redandwhiteswirled marble floors siennahued granite walls towering lacquered columns and brass trim aim to communicate luxury Reflections of light shimmer vibrantly on the high sheen surfaces and the floor is so slick that placards warn users of slippery conditions when shoes are wet from rain or snow The atrium is crowned by a 1600squarefoot stained glass ceiling by artist Hank Prussing composed of geometric patterns rendered in vivid blues purples yellows and browns An elaborate multilevel conveyance system connects level to level Parallel escalators arrayed eastwest link the Fifth Avenue side of the first floor to the second floor Escalators at the eastern side of the first floor track the same route but descend to the concourse level Escalators tying second and third floors pass each other in opposite directions along a northsouth alignment A tubeshapedglassandbrasstrimmed elevator reminiscent of John Portmaninfluenced hotel atria rises at the southeast corner and people enter it as much for the ride as for purposeful transportation Taken together these transport devices visually summon forth a tame version of Fritz Langs Metropolis and its pulsating systems of movementThe concourse level harbors a number of usable amenities A central court is framed by elegant marble planters filled with colorful flowers and plants Metal benches are nestled against the inside wall of the planters between six fourstory lacquered columns Pleasantsounding small fountains sparkling with uplights flank the escalators Surrounding the court is an outer corridor meant to be fronted by retail stores and a restaurant to the north The tables and chairs here appear to be used by the adjacent restaurant but should be available to members of the public without obligation to purchase anything Restrooms are located near the southeast corner of the outer corridor but were locked at a recent site visit Another public restroom is available off the southeast corner of the public area on the second floorWith all the accoutrements the retail promise of the space has yet to be realized According to marketing literature distributed by the building around the time it opened 15 years ago This 55000 square foot retail phenomenon will be surrounded in all directions by some of the most prestigious stores to be found anywhere The plan was for fashion apparel stores to occupy the second and third floors for small boutiques carrying fashion accessories to be on the first floor and for everything from a wine bar to a gourmet food shop to stores selling stationery luggage and home furnishings to line the concourse floor Although some national clothing retailers have rented space here the atrium has not yet achieved the goal set forth in its literature and storefronts especially at upper and concourse floors have suffered from vacanciesWhy has this atrium had a mixed record as a retail space Retail experts might spotlight the inherent difficulties associated with vertical retailing the store mix the design layout changing retail trends and the street location Urban planners and designers might question the validity of an internalized vertical specialty retail mall on one of the worlds greatest shopping streets Adopted in 1971 the Special Fifth Avenue District zoning encouraged such covered pedestrian spaces with floor area bonuses in the belief that the Fifth Avenue sidewalks were becoming too crowded for their own good and that more retail opportunities along the street would be helpful It was not necessarily endorsing or vouchsafing a market concept however In the end the weakness of retail activity might simply suggest that people prefer to shop at street level from sidewalks especially when that street is Fifth AvenueHow then should the success of Trump Tower itself a vertical mall be understood Trump was earlier bigger flashier blessed with a few marquee highend retailers and situated at a higher traffic location Its success may be measured in tourist crowds although such crowds do not always translate into hard retail dollars Indeed much of Trump Towers retail is of greater interest to tourists than to New Yorkers For the public space user however the relative underuse of 575 Fifth Avenue augments its allure Huge retail success here might ironically detract from one of the spaces

who have enjoyed eating conversing reading and resting here the presence of these users has epitomized the ideal of an inclusive noncommercial privately owned public space in the heart of the cityPerhaps it is this deeply felt affection indeed sense of public ownership that explains why a proposal put forward several years ago by the buildings new owner to remove some of the emblematic 45foothigh bamboo tree stands and install in their stead a sculpture exhibition area with vaguely private commercial overtones  art for trees  was greeted with some dismay When the Minskoff ownership group purchased the IBM building in 1994 and applied to the City Planning Commission one year later for permission to modify the space alarm bells sounded Here was someone about to tamper with sacrosanct public space something that could be tolerated only if it were conclusively demonstrated that the changes would improve existing conditionsThe owner originally proposed to reduce from 11 to 5 the number of bamboo tree stands and remove the low dish planters to make physical and visual way for the indoor sculpture garden displaying largescale artworks by major artists of the twentieth century rotated regularly under the direction of the Pace Wildenstein Gallery The owner also proposed to increase the amount of seating albeit with benches substituting for some of the movable chairs to decrease the number of movable tables and to relocate the food kiosk from southwest to southeast corners making it more visible from Madison Avenue After hearing arguments for and against the changes and after the owner agreed to retain 8 of 11 bamboo stands install additional movable chairs without benches and keep the tables the City Planning Commission gave its approvalPublic response has generally tracked originally expressed opinions for and against the modification Although some observers are disappointed with the results others are gratified that the space has retained some of its most salient qualities and introduced a new one The 65foothigh triangular glasscovered atrium remains an aesthetically dramatic yet peaceful room Supported by a structure of crisscrossing white metal tubing the serrated glass roof and glass walls framing East 56th Street and part of Madison Avenue permit streams of sunlight to splash the bamboo trees and wash the white granite floor At times the light is so intense that it gives the space a faded look especially during the summer months although the looming host tower to the northeast and the Sony tower south across the street anchor the user in the very real very dense midtown ManhattanWhile Wordsworths brotherhood of venerable trees has been diminished and the planters once filled with brightly colored azaleas lilies and tulips that changed with the seasons are sadly absent sculptures by such artists as Henry Moore Karel Appel and Alexander Calder have taken their place Together with Levitated Mass 1982 environmental artist Michael Heizers sculpture in the urban plaza at the northwest corner of East 56th Street and Madison Avenue consisting of an 11ton stone incised with a coded building address and resting in a stainless steel basin of rushing water and the classic red steel Calder under the arcade overhang at the southwest corner of East 57th Street and Madison the public spaces here have become something of a public art magnetAnd significantly the space continues to rank high on usability Numerous movable silvercolored chairs and granitetopped tables are scattered about the seating area a space physically indistinguishable from the covered pedestrian space as people form their social patterns of individual and collective activity The food kiosk serves light lunch snacks and beverages and hopefully will keep the volume of its music turned down Even when the lack of air conditioning during the summer combines with the bamboo trees to foster a semitropical environment the space is never too uncomfortable and air conditioning is just steps away at the Trump Tower and Sony covered pedestrian spacesThe covered pedestrian space and seating area may be entered from both East 56th and 57th Streets between Madison and Fifth Avenues via a through block arcade that is open along its eastern side to the spaces from the northwest corner of East 56th Street and Madison Avenue via the urban plaza and through a passageway from Trump Tower and Niketown from the west Together with Sonys throughblock covered pedestrian space across East 56th Street the through block arcade creates one of the Citys six midblock pedestrian networks Together with the passageway connecting to Niketown and Trump Towers covered pedestrian space it is possible to reach Fifth Avenue Indeed the combination of 590 Madison Avenue and Trump Tower creates the Citys only complex of indoor connected privately owned public spaces uninterrupted by a street and provides an instructive contrast between a covered pedestrian space largely defined by commercial and one defined by largely noncommercial qualitiesSeveral other changes have occurred over the years The IBM Gallery of Science and Art that once hosted such exhibits as American Paintings from the Toledo Museum of Art and Manet to Matisse The Maurice Wertheim Collection has been replaced by the Newseum a media museum funded by the Freedom Forum The New York Botanical Gardens branch store is closed The space has a new name 590 Atrium but in the hearts and minds of its loyal users it will continue to be known as the IBM

River Tower,420 East 54 Street,Sited diagonally on a throughblock parcel fronting East 53rd and 54th Streets between Sutton Place South and First Avenue this residential tower generates three distinct areas of residential plaza two of which offer contrasting but equally pleasant environments The capacious brickpaved triangle west of the buildings East 54th Street frontage produces a welcome sensation of openness on a side street otherwise characterized by dense residential fabric The public sidewalk and plaza flow seamlessly into one another employing the same paving trees and grade level This effectively enlarges the plaza by the size of the public sidewalkThe space unfolds to the south with west and east sides converging at a false horizon point at the back The massing of buildings at offsite locations is thankfully sympathetic assuring that sunlight reaches the plaza at various times during the day The western edge is settled by a tall wall a foreground planter filled with trees shrubs and flowers and a lineup of six wooden garden benches The vertical presentation of landscaping is well done with greenery skillfully arrayed at tree canopy understory and ground levels The eastern edge is formed by the edge of the building and its nonrequired arcade In the middle of the space but without the dominating impact associated with artwork located at other public spaces is an unidentified sculpture fabricated from three black metal vertical strips What does dominate here is the openness perfect for the wide variety of users ranging from parents and other caregivers with babies to teenage skateboarders and skaters seeking the wideopen range Building residents use the space Indeed as with many of the better plaza designs the location of the towers primary entrance assures that residents as well as members of the public will at least walk through the space and such common ownership by private and public interests helps assure higherquality maintenance and less of an us versus them attitudeThe second area of residential plaza wisely provides a different experience Located east of the tower and its arcaded dropoff driveway this landscaped terrace is designed for quieter activities of reading and relaxing The space is almost completely overlaid with treeand flowerfilled planters making the remaining usable space all the more valuable Nestled between two planters at back are three benches isolated it would seem from everything but a persons own thoughts The background noise of the driveway fountain is soothing the planting fragrance delightful If there is no room here and the contrasting openness to the west is not preferred then the St James Tower residential plaza directly across East 54th Street furnishes a similar if less intimate landscaped settingThe third and final area of residential plaza located on East 53 rd Street at the back of the tower comes closest to leftover space Planters trees and sittable ledges do not automatically create a pleasing physical environment To get from here to the better portions on East 54th Street is not easy however Although the spaces are physically connected by way of arcades under east and west sides of the tower they are not legally connected because the arcades are not part of the public space network Thus the pedestrian theoretically would need permission from the owner to traverse its private arcades In the early 1990s the City and owner engaged in litigation over how this residential plaza had been provided The case was eventually settled and the result has been an important neighborhood asset,-73.963515,,10022,https://apops.mas.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/2009420-E.-54th-St.-2-e1350882543747.jpg,40.755759,,Manhattan,,"Bicycle Parking: racks provided in sidewalkDrinking Fountain: 54th Street Plaza: 1Lighting: 7 free-standing pole-lights, 14 planter luminairesLitter Receptacles: 53rd Street Plaza: 1; 54th Street Plaza: 3Planting: 53rd Street Plaza: 297 sf provided; 54th Street Plaza: 4179 sf providedPlaque/Sign: 53rd Street Plaza: 1 entry, 1 info; 54th Street Plaza: 2 entry, 1 infoSeating: 53rd Street Plaza: 33.5 LF seating provided; 54th Street Plaza: 195.29 LF seating provided, including 26 movable chairsTrees on Street: 7Trees within Space: 53rd Street Plaza: 4; 54th Street Plaza: 18",POPS,24

Citigroup Center,153 East 53 Street,When completed in 1975 the Citicorp building as it was then named garnered initial attention for its silvery aluminumclad tower poised for takeoff on four 10story stilts and topped with a rakish slanted roof But its interior design quickly gained an independent reputation among members of the public and public space specialists Although the building exhibited four different kinds of privately owned public space  a plaza open air concourse through block arcade and covered pedestrian space  it was the covered pedestrian space and its sevenstory atrium that became the featured attractionThe development occupies almost the entire block bounded by Lexington and Third Avenues and East 53rd and 54th Streets excluding a small area at the corner of East 53rd Street and Third Avenue In its middle is the 7247squarefoot covered pedestrian space on the buildings concourse level below the street There are six access points from the surrounding streets including two entrances to the through block arcade and down the escalator from either East 53rd or 54th Streets between Third and Lexington Avenues another entrance on East 53rd Street closer to Lexington Avenue an entrance from the plaza down steps into and through the open air concourse from the northeast corner of East 53rd Street and Lexington Avenue an entrance from the Lexington Avenue plaza closer to East 54th Street through exterior and interior corridors and down an escalator and an entrance down steps from the southwest corner of East 54th Street and Third Avenue and through a private restaurant This last path is confusing even treacherous as users must navigate past waiters patrons and crowded tables along a trail that is not always expressly delineated Still compared with most indoor spaces containing belowground levels this one is unusually accessible from the street and such permeability is an important element in enticing pedestrians to visit otherwise offthepath belowground interiorsOnce there the full scope of the cavernous atrium is revealed rising seven stories and cresting in three glass Aframe skylights The covered pedestrian space level is ringed by circulation corridors and storefronts at concourse and street levels while the upper levels consist of glass picture windows interspersed with bands of polished aluminum Public space users from below watch the office tenants above as much or more than the office occupants peer downThe space features a cornucopia of usable amenities Numerous movable round and square tables and chairs are packed onto the polished granite floor The kiosk and surrounding stores furnish food for a crowd that especially at lunchtime can be so large that people sometimes must wait for tables and chairs Thankfully even at noon when crowds begin to gather the space is never too noisy or chaotic Its size absorbs sound while its muted lighting scheme and natural sunlight intermittently filtering through the skylight calm the visual scene The recent addition of muzak will hopefully be shortlived The requirement that there be one use or sales area for every 25 feet of frontage on the East 53rd Street side of the space is meant to encourage a diversity of casual restaurants and takeout facilities that in the past has worked so well here The womens restroom is located underneath the East 54th Street through block arcade entry the mens under the East 53rd Street entrySince its opening 25 years ago this covered pedestrian space has displayed a mix of identities molded by private and public aspirations For a time it sought status as a shopping mall advertising itself through snazzy marketing plaques as the Market in the Atrium where The Skys the Limit Boogie Woogie Rock n Roll And All that Jazz Little Bit of Broadway And Lots of Razzmatazz Its Magical A Festival A Carnival Day and Night A Pure Delight Come on in the Atrium For Fun For Free The Place to Be Market realities and strategic repositioning eventually altered this approach replacing it with more modest retail goalsIn the late 1980s and early 1990s the space was heavily used on weekends by immigrants from Hungary Czechoslovakia when it still was Czechoslovakia and other Eastern European countries They would come in weekly from Forest Hills and other city neighborhoods for a rendezvous and snack with friends That Citicorp the quintessential representative of capitalism should provide space for a reconstituted community of Iron Curtain country refugees was an amusement commented upon by several of the regulars The space to this day serves as venue for special occasions One group of cousins arranges a yearly gettogether as their spokesperson describes We come from Brooklyn This is a great meeting place We have the restaurants here and we have a favorite    and then we come back here and have our dessert and coffee and talk a little longer and we show pictures of our children wedding pictures children and whatever I like seeing people of all ages too I like to study them There are all kinds that make up the world and you can see some that are very lonely others studying The space appears to be best understood as a hybrid neither fully dedicated to retail like Trump Tower nor fully devoid of retail like 590 Madison Avenue It gains much of its identity from its diverse changing set of users like neighborhoods throughout the cityThe covered pedestrian space is one of two indoor spaces here Entered down several steps from the public sidewalk the through block arcade bisects the building east and one level above the covered pedestrian space floor connecting East 53rd and 54th Streets The level change from the sidewalk tends to hide the through block arcade from sidewalk pedestrians discouraging pedestrians from using a shortcut that requires marching down and up steps The two outdoor spaces are best understood from a standing start at the northeast corner of Lexington Avenue and East 53rd Street At street level is the plaza a small sliver of extra sidewalk along the avenue that features a wellutilized seating ledge and three flagpoles It would be interesting for flagpoles a common obstruction in public spaces to fly specially designed public space flags along with more traditional ones The plaza sliver closest to East 54th Street fronts the geometrically challenging St Peters Church known for its jazz vespers organ recitals and Louise Nevelson sculptures A window on East 54th Street allows the pedestrian to watch the congregationLike 55 Water Street with its elevated plaza Citigroup Center is one of a small group of catalyst buildings whose proposed development literally inspired the legal introduction of a new category of bonused public space the open air concourse to the Zoning Resolution The twolevel sunken open air concourse is entered down 24 steps from the corner of Lexington Avenue and East 53rd Street Water cascades along the face of a primitive monolithic structure next to the steps reaching its aural crescendo at the bottom Softened by several trees growing out of the pavement the upper level of the open air concourse is dedicated to circulation into the building interior and the covered pedestrian space to the east and into the subway station to the southeast A lower level north and down another eight steps supplies metal tables and seats The views from here are stimulating Above and east is the underbelly of the cantilevered tower whose awesome mass and engineering convey the feeling one might have at the base of a rocket Another view of the church interior is available to the

I really love this park. Every time I go there it feels like take a week vacation from the noisy and rushy city. You can find a lot of things to do there: zoo, lakes, castle, playground, etc. You can play many sports like baseball, volleyball, tennis, go swimming or skiing. Central Park is huge and has a nice view of the city.   There you can find many animals, like ducks, turtles, many types of birds. You can fish on the lakes (have to return what you got).   Bridges is another thing, there are many of them, really nice and iconic like Bow Bridge.   Conservatory Garden is a beautiful place in which people go to relax and appreciate the flowers.   One of my favorite places there is the Shakespeare Garden, the colorful flowers and the arrangements are wonderful.  The Metropolitan Museum of Art is also there on the East Side of the park, a huge museum with great pieces of art, a must-go in the city.  An activity a recommend is taking a bike and ride the whole park is a really nice experience and it will take you about one hour.

This is a great spot for photos while visiting the city too - an iconic photo spot for sure. Central Park is the perfect spot to bring kids too. You can enjoy watching the toy sailboats, find the Alice in Wonderland statue, or take a spin on the carousel. If your looking for an adult outing, you can enjoy a glass of wine at one of the few restaurants inside the park. Another handy tip is that cutting through the park by foot is usually faster, and more enjoyable, than taking a cab across the city. /AUTHOR: MrPechenjuwka /RATING: 5 /TEXT: It's really HUGE.

Philip Morris,120 Park Avenue,Burnishing its image as a leading arts patron the Philip Morris Company has devoted much of its glass and graniteenclosed multistory covered pedestrian space to a successful collaboration with the Whitney Museum of American Art Located at the southwest corner of Park Avenue and East 42nd Street across from Grand Central Terminal and open seven days a week the space has displayed sculptures from that museums permanent collection since it was completed in 1982 With the Whitney able to exhibit only a small percentage of its collection at any one time arrangements such as this can benefit spacehungry museums corporate patrons and members of the public alike Indeed such collaborative efforts are models for cultural institutions seeking new locations and audiences for their exhibits concert series dramatic presentations and similar artistic endeavors and for privately owned public space owners wondering how they may revitalize their spacesThe covered pedestrian space may be entered either from East 42nd Street or Park Avenue under an arcade wrapping around north and east sides of the building Unlike some designs this one unapologetically separates the private lobby entrance from the public space entrance locating the private entrance at the northwest corner of Park Avenue and East 41st Street The closest that public space users come to that lobby is via a view through windows on the western and southern walls of the space Despite this separation there is no evidence whatsoever that the space has been disowned by its host buildingThe Park Avenue entrance offers the most dramatic entrance placing the user on a terrace seven steps above the floor and providing a vantage point from which to survey the space the artworks and the functional amenities With its substantial height narrow width and gray granite columns the space could have conveyed an austere formality were it not for its use of generously sized windows on all four walls that cleverly expand the visual boundaries and allow in large amounts of natural daylight In combination with recessed ceiling lights the windows guarantee a light and airy atmosphere unusual for most indoor privately owned public spaces The artwork also humanizes the space Over the years sculptures have been scattered about in close proximity with users spawning an informal immediacy delightfully at variance with the customary formal museum setting Longtime visitors may recall George Segals buoyant bronze with white patina called Dancers of four nude women dancing

The back side off the park is almost always taken over by highschoolers playing wall ball or basketball meaning that playing in those areas is near impossible unless you play wall ball or basketball. The swings are very relaxing and the overall vibe of the park is calm. The park is very busy all the time and the fact that Elmhurst Hospital is right across the street adds an extra sense of security. I recommend going to the park near the evening, (4 or 5) or earlier in the day (1 or 2) if you have the time. Going earlier during the day allows you to access all parts of the park without having to wait your turn. However, make sure you guard your belongings because sometimes they might get stolen.

The organizers do a great job with the DJ selection, the vendors, security, and utilizing the space that they have. However it would be nice if they could spread out the stages a little bit more so the sound doesn't bleed into one another. It's a 3 day event and I think all 3 days is a perfect amount of time to get as much entertainment in for what's being offered here. The wide variety of food they offer is amazing from vegan options to meat eaters they seem to have everything covered. I deducted a star for the outrageous prices they charge for admission and food. Two cocktails were $36 and they were in small plastic cups loaded with ice. I had asked for no ice one time and they said that its something they could not do unless they only fill it up half. I thought that was super tacky. For the amount of money we're spending on admission which was a little over $600 for 2 adults/3 days they should have been a little bit more generous with food and drink prices. Although the festival was totally worth it where it's only a yearly event. Not sure if I would attend again next year where this year was the 10-year anniversary. I'll probably explore other festivals but it's definitely something everyone should experience at least once. /AUTHOR: Kamila Sarman Porter /RATING: 5 /TEXT: We went to Randall's Island for the Vegansdale Fest.
