Marine Park/Jhs 278-K,4.4,50,11229,9270,2135 Stuart Street,Brooklyn," /AUTHOR: Swaggy B /RATING: 5 /TEXT: This is the absolute worst school you can go to. The teachers are SOOOo bad. I don't like any of the teachers and I hate all of them. The classes are so boring and the school doesn't prepare any of the students for any of the exams. ITS A TERRIBLE  SCHOOL. Don't send your child here. Sike its a very good school, and yes you should send your child here because it does prepare you for every test and its a very good school. Although it does get boring sometimes, I mean every school is boring but its still very FUN. I love this school!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! /AUTHOR: Yazmurat A. /RATING: 5 /TEXT: This is my favorite school I've ever been in and I'm happy I got in honors class and that was an improvement because I was first in 6-3. Also the teachers, some are pretty chill and its fun and if it was a specialized high school, I would've worked so hard to get in and I prepare to Stuyvesant high school. Over the summer, I was asked if I wanted to go to either Coney Island prep or Marine Park, and I obviously chose my school and I was stressed out when they first said I had to go but then I convinced them but even if I didn't, they gave me a final choice any ways.  Now my top teacher from last year was Ms.Duro. This year it is Mr.Tupper . But for some of the other subject teachers, well, I liked the class better than I liked them no offense!(Not gonna tell who)My class was fun, BUT, the class was horrible in some subjects and ITSELF for example, English, and sometimes Social Studies and science. The other one blames kids on stuff we didn't do and we go off topic which will probably make me like the class more than the teacher :D. Sorry. Anyhoo I had an essay once with I got an 88 and told the teacher I didn't get extra points for typing and I got a 93 which 88 was the grade with extra points its just that it said no extra and when I got the essay it already showed 88 with extra points which means I got an 83 and got extra points but I acted like it was a solid 88 at the start. So basically my grade with the extra points was supposed to be an 88 not 93 and I was unhesitant when I told my teacher and it was verified which therefore means I got 10 added points instead of 5. Another time I couldn't finish an essay because at March 24, at 2017 when I was in 6th grade, I had to get my nose surgery and I was absent for a day of the state exam week because of recovery and at the last exam, I had to get my Doyle splints removed from my nose and I didn't give in the essay and I remember it was marked as a 4. I can get away with homework WAY TO EASILY. Ive done it a lot and I try to be too wise sometimes and I can do it again but one thing I won't do is lie. I didn't say bye to any of my teachers at the last day of 6th grade :c. I haven't said hi  my math and English teacher until November and December, which is funny because Ms.Duro my math teacher was my fav. I saw my art teacher from last year in January 2018 which is also sad because she was too nice. I didn't meet my science teacher yet lol. /AUTHOR: Adelia /RATING: 5 /TEXT: Really good school best debate team ever. Have an okay band team.

One of the highlights was speaking firsthand with one of the veterans who served on the ship during one of its many journeys. Highly recommended. There are a few steep staircases if you want to head up to the bridge, but otherwise access is very well catered for throughout the ship. /AUTHOR: George Furst /RATING: 5 /TEXT: I visited this Air and Space Museum while visiting the New York area in November. It is located along the Hudson River and well worth visiting. They have an impressive group of military equipment including an aircraft carrier and post World War Two submarine. There are also a number of airplanes and helicopters on the deck of the aircraft carrier. If you have never been on an aircraft carrier this is you chance to learn how large this key to winning of World War Two was. It is an impressive city on the water that contains thousands of sailors and was very important during the Cold War and is still very important. The fee to see this museum is reasonable and if you are a veteran, there is no fee. I would recommend that you spend at least three hours during your visit as there is so much to see. This included a visit to the inside of the submarine and also the interior of the aircraft carrier. There are also guides that will explain about each of the areas you visit on the aircraft carrier. Also the submarine has excellent diagrams about the history of this important navy ship and explain how they were able to save it from the scrap yard and bring it from the west coast near Seattle to its final resting place here in New York City. I can not recommend a visit to this museum enough.

Randalls Island Park,4.3,2187,,23177,Wards Island,Manhattan," /AUTHOR: Mary Love /RATING: 4 /TEXT: Been coming to this Festival The Last couple Years and I have a blast every time. The organizers do a great job with the DJ selection, the vendors, security, and utilizing the space that they have. However it would be nice if they could spread out the stages a little bit more so the sound doesn't bleed into one another. It's a 3 day event and I think all 3 days is a perfect amount of time to get as much entertainment in for what's being offered here. The wide variety of food they offer is amazing from vegan options to meat eaters they seem to have everything covered. I deducted a star for the outrageous prices they charge for admission and food. Two cocktails were $36 and they were in small plastic cups loaded with ice. I had asked for no ice one time and they said that its something they could not do unless they only fill it up half. I thought that was super tacky. For the amount of money we're spending on admission which was a little over $600 for 2 adults/3 days they should have been a little bit more generous with food and drink prices. Although the festival was totally worth it where it's only a yearly event. Not sure if I would attend again next year where this year was the 10-year anniversary. I'll probably explore other festivals but it's definitely something everyone should experience at least once. /AUTHOR: Kamila Sarman Porter /RATING: 5 /TEXT: We went to Randall's Island for the Vegansdale Fest.

There are also presentations and discussions here and at the Historical Society's headquarters not directly, but across the street. /AUTHOR: Jose Perez /RATING: 4 /TEXT: EL CERTOR DE ROCHAMBEAU VANCOLAN BENBRIGE AV ES MUY BUENO ESA AREA Y EL PARQUE NATURAL WILIAN BRIHS ES BUENISIMO /AUTHOR: Imtiaz Ahmed /RATING: 4 /TEXT: ",40.87738,http://bronxhistoricalsociety.org/museum-of-bronx-history/valentine-varian-house-history/,-73.879431,https://maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/place/photo?maxwidth=1788&photoreference=CmRaAAAADZiz9MEk6BDyRaXezGsnPTnUEVMBIfarab_VomOX4G7lKqHZnnBsVJpmCCmycUjVZ-2_E9_O7bWekt0TeIzBhmCBis1ZgD5vCIAqebwBJ-P8n9ebYY1Ebx1hq-U0iEUcEhDmDrvrwm3DZFooOMfYoCY-GhSY5C45Nbdb7QgCgtOEGKQlSMry2Q&key=AIzaSyBYcuFsV7KTFtJsVKVFcrOEhKYhqpv8V7Y,"['Monday: Closed', 'Tuesday: Closed', 'Wednesday: Closed', 'Thursday: Closed', 'Friday: Closed', 'Saturday: 10:00 AM – 4:00 PM', 'Sunday: 1:00 – 5:00 PM']",Park

Jhs 68 And Playground (Jop),3.3,39,11236,102491,956 East   82 Street,Brooklyn," /AUTHOR: KokoMo Senpai /RATING: 1 /TEXT: PLEASE READ ! Hello, I was a prior alumni for this school and I prefer to stay anonymous. This school is a painfully hard experience if you are/were a kid just trying to learn or partake in extracurricular activities. The teachers are biased towards certain children. For example, if you were a (troubled) child they would let you freely roam the school whenever you wanted to as well as say whatever you wanted to whoever you wanted without consequence while, If you were a goal oriented/ quiet / non trouble making kid, they wouldn't even let you use the bathroom much less talk out of place once without the risk of detention or a phone home. This slackness not only causes the bad kids to make trouble for the good children but makes the good children aspire to be as bad as the bad kids because of the faculty's negligence and bad decision making along with the perceived privileges to be received amongst being rebellious. How do I know this? I was bullied very harshly (along with my female cousin and my friends) because we were those few kinds of kids still willing to learn the material rather than be bad or make a name for themselves. Also, it would be wise of you to teach your kid how to fight before attending this school because not only does this school have a lot of fights amongst themselves but they also fight other schools aswell ! I was jumped on a staircase, jumped on my way to school later getting stomped out and even had a knife pulled on me. Report after report after report and nothing was done. My mom even went as far as to file a police report and the school tried to lie and say it was off school grounds even though it was inside the school's recess yard. Sadly all the reports aimed towards the faculty fell on deaf ears and nothing was resolved but somehow the bullies heard just fine since they always found out you told on them. So before you were getting fought for no reason and now you were getting fought for snitching. I remember I finally said enough was enough and I tried to walk out. As I neared the door a security guard took me to the assistant principal's office to talk about it and I explained everything to her from the bullying to the teachers withholding vital learning material to let the kids do whatever they wanted during class. She took away my prom , every school trip for the rest of the year, detention for the rest of the week and threatened my graduation. I was crushed. After that day I just stopped going and it was pretty early in the school year as well. A month before graduation I got a call from them stating I had good enough test scores and work grades prior to leaving so it was possible for me to graduate even though they robbed me of 3 years of my childhood and education. Lucky me right? Listen, whether you want to send your kid here or not is up to you but if your kid is a hard working, ambitious, quiet or even generally good person please don't send them here. It still haunts my cousin, friends and I that we had to go through all of that just to get a education from that school. /AUTHOR: Rabia Asif /RATING: 4 /TEXT: I loved all my teachers, just had very little trips, but, still one of my best memorable places ever! /AUTHOR: Valentino /RATING: 1 /TEXT: The worst school ever mad fights all most very day but at the school there is only 4 good teachers mister nickaleta miss sagen mister  shocen /AUTHOR: Isaiah Gaming /RATING: 3 /TEXT: The School ain't so good but it's good.

The organizers do a great job with the DJ selection, the vendors, security, and utilizing the space that they have. However it would be nice if they could spread out the stages a little bit more so the sound doesn't bleed into one another. It's a 3 day event and I think all 3 days is a perfect amount of time to get as much entertainment in for what's being offered here. The wide variety of food they offer is amazing from vegan options to meat eaters they seem to have everything covered. I deducted a star for the outrageous prices they charge for admission and food. Two cocktails were $36 and they were in small plastic cups loaded with ice. I had asked for no ice one time and they said that its something they could not do unless they only fill it up half. I thought that was super tacky. For the amount of money we're spending on admission which was a little over $600 for 2 adults/3 days they should have been a little bit more generous with food and drink prices.

Every time I go there it feels like take a week vacation from the noisy and rushy city. You can find a lot of things to do there: zoo, lakes, castle, playground, etc. You can play many sports like baseball, volleyball, tennis, go swimming or skiing. Central Park is huge and has a nice view of the city.   There you can find many animals, like ducks, turtles, many types of birds. You can fish on the lakes (have to return what you got).   Bridges is another thing, there are many of them, really nice and iconic like Bow Bridge.   Conservatory Garden is a beautiful place in which people go to relax and appreciate the flowers.   One of my favorite places there is the Shakespeare Garden, the colorful flowers and the arrangements are wonderful.  The Metropolitan Museum of Art is also there on the East Side of the park, a huge museum with great pieces of art, a must-go in the city.  An activity a recommend is taking a bike and ride the whole park is a really nice experience and it will take you about one hour.   There are also boats you can rent and spend a really nice time in The Lake. /AUTHOR: mindy weiss /RATING: 5 /TEXT: What a great way to spend your day whether your a New Yorker or a tourist the park offers so much to do I love the row boats they are a lot of fun!!!

I walked all the way across the park, from south to north. I knew it was ambitious, but in real life it was even larger and more impressive than I understood. If you go to NYC, you should under NO circumstances, skip your chance to visit and enjoy this park! It's fantastic! /AUTHOR: Natalie Irwin /RATING: 5 /TEXT: Fantastic spot in New York City for everything - from running, to walking, to biking or sitting and enjoying some fresh air (and shade in the summer!). This is a great spot for photos while visiting the city too - an iconic photo spot for sure. Central Park is the perfect spot to bring kids too. You can enjoy watching the toy sailboats, find the Alice in Wonderland statue, or take a spin on the carousel. If your looking for an adult outing, you can enjoy a glass of wine at one of the few restaurants inside the park. Another handy tip is that cutting through the park by foot is usually faster, and more enjoyable, than taking a cab across the city. /AUTHOR: MrPechenjuwka /RATING: 5 /TEXT: It's really HUGE. I spent almost two days exploring it from South to North and there still were few things I couldn't catch because of the rain.

Got a Groupon for laser hair removal and I called right away to make an appointment. First, they do not pick up their phone. EVER. Finally got through to them via text to make an appointment. They didn't have anything for a month out which seemed excessive, but I decided to make it anyway. Then, they ask me to give my CC info over text, which I don't feel comfortable doing since I have no idea who or what I'm texting and I already paid for the Groupon. I try calling to give it over the phone since they insisted, but no answer. Try calling the next day, no answer. Do this for 5 days and finally text them to say I've been trying to call and so they call me and tell me they were on the other line. Lie...were they really on the other line 4 days in a row? Sure. So then they say they ""reviewed our conversation"" and would like to let me know that unfortunately despite my upcoming appointment, one of their machines is broken so they have to move my appointment and ask if a month later is ok. A MONTH. Apparently they only have 2 machines and one can only be used by one technician so there's nothing they can do. No new machine, no fixing the broken one, no having someone ELSE just use the one they have to open up appointments. No thank you. Asking Groupon for my money back and spending it elsewhere. Somewhere with better customer service and work ethic.  Edit: since they replied they have ""no record"" of me, I added a photo of Groupon suggesting I use my voucher because it had been THAT long since I purchased and couldn't use.

They have plenty of swings and 3 play structures - 2 for smaller kids so you don't have to worry about the bigger kids running over them. In the mornings, the little kid swings are often hogged by nannies on cellphones who keep their little charges in the swings for a long time, so you may need  to wait. There are plenty of benches and half if it is usually shaded. I only come here in the mornings and afternoons, but it feels safe because Amsterdam has so much foot traffic and the police station is next to the playground. The soccer fields are frequently in use by kids and adults. Only downside is the entrance has a row of benches usually populated by adults hanging out - usually not a problem, but occasionally some loud talk with the kind of talk less than optimal for little kids. /AUTHOR: Jeremiah R.

Early morning is a good idea to beat normal crowd. I am sure after cherry blossom, park is even more beautiful and crowded.  Good place to take pictures and look at the skyline of NYC. This park is very good for kids to run around and have lots of fun. United nations is in the background. Guards are always there in case someone needs help. There is no place to eat around the park but I was told by one vendor that Cornell Tech has cafeteria which is open on weekends. I would love to go again and explore more on Roosevelt island. There is a donation box if you would like to contribute. /AUTHOR: R Koch /RATING: 4 /TEXT: Nice getaway from the city. Peaceful and quiet. An old stone lighthouse at one end of the island and the ruins of a former smallpox hospital at the other. Might as well walk both ends. Plenty of places to sit along the water on either side.

Public Place,3.3,30,11422,42528,Brookville Boulevard,Queens," /AUTHOR: Mordechai Twersky /RATING: 1 /TEXT: The fact it took 4 years to open and somehow hold less books than the first one is mind-boggling to me. For some reason the city decided to focus on the building being beneficial to the environment and a modern design then actual being a library.  The grass on the roof is an interesting touch but you know what I would rather? A larger book selection, a separate quite room for studying, staff that don't seem to loath you for having the gall to take out a few books. Just not impressed with this library and the small selection of books spread out across the half empty shelves. Its also quite amusing that a worker of this branch gives here branch 5 stars as if she isn't completely biased. Also this worker claims that even though we have a ""negative perception "" (read that as ""legitimate complaints"") of the library, we should just be happy we have a library at all. Are you kidding me? Your response to people complaining about the library's service is ""we are awesome, just be happy you have a library."" Instead of lecturing us to be more thankful for the lackluster performance from a library branch that took 4 years and 10 million dollars to build, how about actually addressing the problems visitors have? If the city can spend 10 million dollars on the building and pay workers a salary to ignore the fact I'm waiting to check out books, the city should be able to fill the empty selves and employee workers who care about the visitors in this glorified greenhouse. Also Its nice that the library ""cares"" but if I don't see this ""care"" then it doesn't really help me if you claim its there. Also you can claim you ""know for a fact employees go out of their way to help"" but some of the people who come to the library don't feel that way. I was going to give the library 2 stars but because of the tone-deafness of the employee's review it has to be a single star. /AUTHOR: RRR /RATING: 3 /TEXT: Stopped by because it was conveniently open on a Sunday. The building was recently renovated (haven't been here before that). It is aesthetically pleasing and airy. There's a large selection of books, DVD's and seating. Children's section is loud, crowded, noisy and disheveled. Parking in surrounding area is very difficult. /AUTHOR: Susan Paredes /RATING: 5 /TEXT: Working as the current branch Manager for Kew Gardens Hills has been a privilege for me. Having worked for Queens library for over 12 years  I see the hard work our staff,   throughout the whole borough of Queens in general, provide services for our community. They go out of their ways to assist patrons on immigration paper to simply assisting patrons assigning them on the computer. I know for a fact we go beyond our ways to assist patrons  needs. I don't think there's anyone in Queens who is not fit to work at our organization not caring about people. Its what we do on a daily basis. That's why we are all fortunate to be working in this organization. We should all be grateful that the City of NYC supports libraries no matter what conditions the buildings is in ; Its the people who matter most and who we try our best to please them with our on going service. I've been in countries where there is no libraries and people struggle with poverty and illiteracy. We should be thankful that this country especially Queens Library gives us the opportunity to be successful whether its having access to the internet or attending to a job business academy, we have a chance to be somebody successful.  For those that have a negative impression about Queens library, think about how fortunate we are to at least have a library that cares. /AUTHOR: Nami Hrd /RATING: 1 /TEXT: I honestly agree with most of the negative comments. The area for the kids/toddlers is also claustrophobic and it's hard for moms and nannies to be able to be with kids in such a miniscule area. It all just feels so closed in and walk room just feels like you would bump into someone randomly so easily. I honestly was excited for the opening of the library only to be let down by a tiny kids area, tiny study table area where there happens to be a book shelf just behind the chairs there so people at the table need to constantly get out of their chair or squeeze themselves against the table in order to allow people get to the books, tiny walkways between bookshelves that can be daunting to just pass through, ridiculous opening hours(seriously opening so late is just upsetting) and a very snarky employee who has a habit of acting like they like shaming people. (Coming from a personal experience.) Things need to be fixed and for goodness sakes, please find a way to have the mommies and nannies park their strollers in a safe and secure area. (Outside the library would be an insecure area in case you think of it. People love stealing from strollers.)  N.B: Also in response to that one worker who essentially said we should just be glad we have a library, just know I also travelled and have been to some badly off areas where they have a better organized library than this. All we ask is for proper structure in the library. It is a nice library but things need to be a bit more reasonable in there. /AUTHOR: Monbebe Forever /RATING: 3 /TEXT: The library looks nice but the selection is not that good!

Fort Tryon Park,4.7,2918,10040,133966,Ft Washington Avenue,Manhattan," /AUTHOR: Will Koehrsen /RATING: 5 /TEXT: A great quiet park in northern Manhattan. The park is generally not overly crowded and is a nice escape from midtown. This is a great place to come for a walk or to enjoy the views. There are also some commercial shops in a fairly quiet neighborhood. In my opinion, definitely worth the subway trip up from lower Manhattan although it's not as grand as Central Park. /AUTHOR: Barry Solow /RATING: 4 /TEXT: Fort Tryon Park is a great place to walk or lounge. There are terrific views of the Hudson River, Washington Heights and Inwood. Just being in the park you are already in one of the (natural) highest elevations in Manhattans and the park itself has hills and terraces which offer further elevations above that. Finally there is, of course, The Cloisters, a museum of medieval art. It's way uptown (take the A train) but it is called well worth a few hours of your time. /AUTHOR: Andrew Knudsen /RATING: 5 /TEXT: I love this park. It's very secluded which is a huge deal for it being in Manhattan.

People of all races converge in this place and there are trails, playing fields, basketball courts and playgrounds for anyone to enjoy year round. Restrooms are found near Bayard Street and near the playgrounds south of Bayard Street, between Baxter and Mulberry Streets. /AUTHOR: John L /RATING: 4 /TEXT: Columbus Park is a NYC park, and it is maintained by the City of New York Park's Department.    It is located in Chinatown, NYC,   and situated behind the NYC Criminal Court on Baxter and Bayard Street.    The park is kind of big for a NYC park, and it does have a basketball court, lawn for soccer matches, lots of benches in and outside the park, playground for the kids and toddlers with swings and other equipment.    Then there tables and chairs also, some are chess tables and some are like picnic tables and long benches.  Plenty of tress and bushes also.  So breakfast and lunch in the park is great on beautiful NYC days.  The folks that frequents the park are moms & kids, nanny & kids, kids from schools there for recess, folks playing basketball,  folks playing soccer,  Attorneys,  District Attorneys, judges, Court Officers and Correction Officers.  It is 1 of the safest park in NYC.   However, It would be a great NYC park to enjoy except there is a bunch of middle age and elderly locals ( men and women)  that occupies the park on a daily basis 365 days a year, and they occupied almost all the tables every day.  What these folks do is play all sorts of card games and other table games all day long, and they just grab and hold the tables for their games.  These folks also have some bad habits besides their bad manners, and I can not even name them for you  except to say to they should stop their bad habits in a NYC park.  The park does entertain tons of folks on a daily basis,  and there are NYC  Park's Department employees  on hand throughout the day maintaining  the park.    However, the park always seems dirty and unkempt whenever I visited.   The several public toilets in the park is real dirty and usually overflowing with some water from somewhere.    Do visit the park if you are in the neighborhood,  but remember to hit the bathrooms before you go.

Frank D. O'Connor Playground,4.1,128,11373,72042,78-08 Broadway,Queens," /AUTHOR: Mir Haque /RATING: 5 /TEXT: This park is a very safe and fun place to take the kids. It's very clean and not very littered. There is a wide variety of areas for children to play with and often times, empty corners of the park are a great place to play soccer because there is more open space. There are a few cons. The back side off the park is almost always taken over by highschoolers playing wall ball or basketball meaning that playing in those areas is near impossible unless you play wall ball or basketball. The swings are very relaxing and the overall vibe of the park is calm. The park is very busy all the time and the fact that Elmhurst Hospital is right across the street adds an extra sense of security. I recommend going to the park near the evening, (4 or 5) or earlier in the day (1 or 2) if you have the time. Going earlier during the day allows you to access all parts of the park without having to wait your turn. However, make sure you guard your belongings because sometimes they might get stolen. Be careful if you are In the front corner of the park (the corner facing the parking lot) because kids like to play soccer there and sometimes they might kick the ball and it might hit you (not very hard however). /AUTHOR: J.p Gonzalez /RATING: 5 /TEXT: Quiet and right by the hospital in an Asian neighborhood.

Soup cans aside, I was astounding to see how prolific this man was. A must see if you're in NYC. Caught the Warhol exhibit in all its splendor. Purchased tickets upon arrival. Booking in advance was not necessary. There is a restaurant on site for table service. We didn't have time for that. Wish they had a grab and go option. We stumbled across this museum at the end of our stroll along the High Line. We decided to go in even through we were not much into American art. It was a risk for the price we paid. /AUTHOR: yougourthen Ayouni /RATING: 4 /TEXT: The Whitney is a pretty remarkable place to begin. If you are in town and want a cool museum to go to, this is one to certainly consider. Things to let you know ahead of time is to purchase your tickets electronically ahead of time so you can skip a 30+ minute wait on the line.  But in light of this, you should have a great time during whatever exhibit you choose to attend. /AUTHOR: Alan Wales /RATING: 5 /TEXT: The Warhol exhibit was delightful. My partner and I especially enjoyed the way the rooms reflected the style of Warhol even down to the paint chosen for the walls. We loved that his mother's work was included as well.

The outdoor terraces give you a great view of Chelsea and Lower Manhattan and when you're done you have immediate access to the High Line as this is it's southern terminus.

Willowbrook Park,4.4,723,10314,104513,Victory Boulevard,Staten+Island," /AUTHOR: Sabrina /RATING: 4 /TEXT: This is a nice park for a day out with the kids or for a leisurely walk alone. There is a trail around a small lake. Only 1/2 the trail is paved and in the open while the other 1/2 is a combination of dirt & gravel and travels through a wooded area. This wooded trail is part of the larger greenbelt white trail. Both paths provide lake views. There are many ducks and geese here so be careful with little kids not in strollers as they are not afraid of people but can still get aggressive sometimes. In the nicer weather, you may also see people fishing (catch & release only).  In addition, this park also has a refurbished antique carousel that is beautiful, with many hand painted animals and scenes depicting Staten Island.  There is a playground adjacent to a picnic area with tables and charcoal grills, an archery field, and a dog run. Also, baseball fields (behind the lake).   This park is easily accessible from Richmond Ave and/or Victory Blvd.   Overall, a great city park whereas once you get inside, you can escape and easily forget that you are in the middle of one of the most congested areas of Staten Island. /AUTHOR: Nicholas /RATING: 5 /TEXT: A beautiful park that leads to trails all across the island.

Every time I go there it feels like take a week vacation from the noisy and rushy city. You can find a lot of things to do there: zoo, lakes, castle, playground, etc. You can play many sports like baseball, volleyball, tennis, go swimming or skiing. Central Park is huge and has a nice view of the city.   There you can find many animals, like ducks, turtles, many types of birds. You can fish on the lakes (have to return what you got).   Bridges is another thing, there are many of them, really nice and iconic like Bow Bridge.   Conservatory Garden is a beautiful place in which people go to relax and appreciate the flowers.   One of my favorite places there is the Shakespeare Garden, the colorful flowers and the arrangements are wonderful.  The Metropolitan Museum of Art is also there on the East Side of the park, a huge museum with great pieces of art, a must-go in the city.  An activity a recommend is taking a bike and ride the whole park is a really nice experience and it will take you about one hour.   There are also boats you can rent and spend a really nice time in The Lake. /AUTHOR: mindy weiss /RATING: 5 /TEXT: What a great way to spend your day whether your a New Yorker or a tourist the park offers so much to do I love the row boats they are a lot of fun!!!

I walked all the way across the park, from south to north. I knew it was ambitious, but in real life it was even larger and more impressive than I understood. If you go to NYC, you should under NO circumstances, skip your chance to visit and enjoy this park! It's fantastic! /AUTHOR: Natalie Irwin /RATING: 5 /TEXT: Fantastic spot in New York City for everything - from running, to walking, to biking or sitting and enjoying some fresh air (and shade in the summer!). This is a great spot for photos while visiting the city too - an iconic photo spot for sure. Central Park is the perfect spot to bring kids too. You can enjoy watching the toy sailboats, find the Alice in Wonderland statue, or take a spin on the carousel. If your looking for an adult outing, you can enjoy a glass of wine at one of the few restaurants inside the park. Another handy tip is that cutting through the park by foot is usually faster, and more enjoyable, than taking a cab across the city. /AUTHOR: MrPechenjuwka /RATING: 5 /TEXT: It's really HUGE. I spent almost two days exploring it from South to North and there still were few things I couldn't catch because of the rain.

Got a Groupon for laser hair removal and I called right away to make an appointment. First, they do not pick up their phone. EVER. Finally got through to them via text to make an appointment. They didn't have anything for a month out which seemed excessive, but I decided to make it anyway. Then, they ask me to give my CC info over text, which I don't feel comfortable doing since I have no idea who or what I'm texting and I already paid for the Groupon. I try calling to give it over the phone since they insisted, but no answer. Try calling the next day, no answer. Do this for 5 days and finally text them to say I've been trying to call and so they call me and tell me they were on the other line. Lie...were they really on the other line 4 days in a row? Sure. So then they say they ""reviewed our conversation"" and would like to let me know that unfortunately despite my upcoming appointment, one of their machines is broken so they have to move my appointment and ask if a month later is ok. A MONTH. Apparently they only have 2 machines and one can only be used by one technician so there's nothing they can do. No new machine, no fixing the broken one, no having someone ELSE just use the one they have to open up appointments. No thank you. Asking Groupon for my money back and spending it elsewhere. Somewhere with better customer service and work ethic.

This playground is mostly popular with the Hasidic Jewish community families as they live all around this area. Don't get me wrong, there are other mix families who visit as well.  The park has some rules that need to be followed. It's not a dog friendly park and that's a good thing due to, there are many people with dogs and don't clean up after them. So there shouldn't be any dog poop and that should make it safer to just sit on the grass. To be honest, I've see people still take their dogs there. There's always those who just don't care or don't read the signs posted out front.  I believe the name for the park, Jacob's Ladder is the connection between the earth and heaven that the biblical Patriarch Jacob dreams about during his flight from his brother Esau, as described in the Book of Genesis. - This is mostly a Hasidic Jewish community, so this makes more sense because it's part of the Old Testament. /AUTHOR: Jayla Elliott /RATING: 5 /TEXT: I go there all the  time I love it /AUTHOR: זעליג פארקאש /RATING: 5 /TEXT: My kids always enjoy this place, lots of place to run around, good place for parents to sit and watch kids playing.  /AUTHOR: BARRY KAYE /RATING: 3 /TEXT: Nice and clean /AUTHOR: Leiby Deutsch /RATING: 5 /TEXT: Good park for children swings benches and grounds.

I believe students have classes here to study productive garden design and other botanical work, there is a area where you can also have an event like a wedding ceremony.

The Cafe bar below is incredible, and the bar next door was great too. Overall highly recommend it, just remember you're still in NYC so the rooms will be small compared to say, a Marriott upstate or something. If you can, try waiting til day of to book your room. It's very risky obviously, but the rate is much cheaper. Or try getting that free upgrade! :) /AUTHOR: Mark Smith /RATING: 5 /TEXT: Martin, the manager, was awesome at making it a social occasion for my fiance's birthday.

Show up early to get a good spot in line. The tests are quick so the line moves so long as everyone is prepared. My tester (708) was phenomenal, very calming presence, very kind. The course they take you on is straightforward, and if you're well prepared the test flies by. Only 5 points off for a wide turn, the testers are totally luck of the draw, but if you get 708, even if you fail he'll make sure you feel confident for your next test (he compliments good maneuvers, and lets you know where you faulted as you do it so you don't have to be confused after!) /AUTHOR: Kendy Tejada /RATING: 5 /TEXT: Examiner# 712 is the best 🙌👍",40.81759,http://dmv.ny.gov/contact-us/road-test-sites-bronx-county,-73.844197,https://maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/place/photo?maxwidth=3024&photoreference=CmRaAAAAJmLUth89hygGoWM_B5cZLg3ktFJiS5Na3S6CVNHoH6VPPmo3hUw2mfcosXjwi5AuAyVS8UoqnBjREXhGyeMfffQqUB_aeqYqMuDrQsHRPXRKkXIm2XFbJEJz7JVfT4VmEhAzt8zH6TKgFHWGaYEmeKYpGhS7tiHCqjEPTlVmVfkxa-3VSJ8aiw&key=AIzaSyBYcuFsV7KTFtJsVKVFcrOEhKYhqpv8V7Y,"['Monday: 8:00 AM – 5:00 PM', 'Tuesday: 8:00 AM – 5:00 PM', 'Wednesday: 8:00 AM – 5:00 PM', 'Thursday: 8:00 AM – 5:00 PM', 'Friday: 8:00 AM – 5:00 PM', 'Saturday: Closed', 'Sunday: Closed']",Garden

Randall's Island Park Addition,4.3,2187,,25250,,Manhattan," /AUTHOR: Mary Love /RATING: 4 /TEXT: Been coming to this Festival The Last couple Years and I have a blast every time. The organizers do a great job with the DJ selection, the vendors, security, and utilizing the space that they have. However it would be nice if they could spread out the stages a little bit more so the sound doesn't bleed into one another. It's a 3 day event and I think all 3 days is a perfect amount of time to get as much entertainment in for what's being offered here. The wide variety of food they offer is amazing from vegan options to meat eaters they seem to have everything covered. I deducted a star for the outrageous prices they charge for admission and food. Two cocktails were $36 and they were in small plastic cups loaded with ice. I had asked for no ice one time and they said that its something they could not do unless they only fill it up half. I thought that was super tacky. For the amount of money we're spending on admission which was a little over $600 for 2 adults/3 days they should have been a little bit more generous with food and drink prices. Although the festival was totally worth it where it's only a yearly event. Not sure if I would attend again next year where this year was the 10-year anniversary. I'll probably explore other festivals but it's definitely something everyone should experience at least once. /AUTHOR: Kamila Sarman Porter /RATING: 5 /TEXT: We went to Randall's Island for the Vegansdale Fest.

There are only about three trees in the lot and on hot days you'll definitely want to park in that shade. This park is right on the water and offers a few fields for soccer, football or softball along with a couple of bike paths. There are lots of trees for shade and being by the water makes for slightly cooler temps on hot days. The grass was mowed and well kept. There is an abundance of space for gatherings and events and there was park staff on hand (rare for any park) to keep the bathrooms stocked with supplies for the crowds. Speaking of bathrooms, they are housed in a modern building with wide open stair access on one side and handicap access on the other. The wide stairs offer views to the water and any event in that area. The only downside is there are no playgrounds or basketball courts, so when bringing kids make sure you have plenty to keep them occupied. /AUTHOR: Shahajahan Pial /RATING: 5 /TEXT: Good place for afternoon walk or morning running..",40.818281,https://www.nycgovparks.org/parks/ferry-point-park,-73.827334,https://maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/place/photo?maxwidth=4048&photoreference=CmRaAAAA_wUdIKvD9D3sUu4hM8vxdhJ2i06vqpyStnbpcloCfeLPq7UJK_aOrlqoal_J2750q7akZNBLlis8ZPgrkzqQUP4OgVRp27XWHq4F_PYnIlAg7Qn9O6DY-Ye-6CQZOfu9EhC2sAwpsObfpbR1CywWqA_9GhQey2gqE3ZzXwwO4XuBn5M16hzB7w&key=AIzaSyBYcuFsV7KTFtJsVKVFcrOEhKYhqpv8V7Y,unknown,Regional Park

The preserve is managed to retain its unique ecology and to provide educational and recreational opportunities for people of all ages. Evidences of the Leni Lenape Indians, European settlers and the Free Blacks of Sandy Ground provide a rich cultural history. Educational programs, such as nature walks, pond ecology, birdwatching and tree and flower identification, are offered, as are many activities geared to school children. School and group programs are also welcome by advance registration. In addition, visitors may picnic or hike on designated trails. Horseback riding is also permitted on over 5 miles of bridle paths.

It has amazing views of the water. You get a great view of 1 World Trade as well. You can also see the Statue of Liberty from the south side and a nice view of New Jersey. It's great for a job around or to just hang out and enjoy the outdoors. /AUTHOR: Olive Gilbert /RATING: 5 /TEXT: Having followed the Statue Cruises map (not reading the text) which places the marker for the Liberty ferry leaving from the jetty at the State Park we were surprised to find we were a good 40min walk from where we wanted to be. Popping into the Rangers office we were bluntly told no ferries left from there, so we enjoyed the waterfront walk instead. A long panorama of the Hudson Bay and seeing Liberty Island from behind made for some good photo opportunities which most visitors wouldn't get. We also read the informative signs along the boardwalk and saw some of the local wildlife. /AUTHOR: Monika Gyongyi Macias Honti /RATING: 4 /TEXT: It is a small park, but if you are looking for a good place to see the sunset and just do a little people-watching it is the perfect spot. Also, you can easily see some of the iconic NY buildings and it is a place full of possibilities and roads you can take: the fery station is literally on one side to the park, the metro station is not far, and there are also many possibilities to look for a tour or just walk around and see what you can find.

Great summer spot, Nathan's is nearby. /AUTHOR: Rob Homa /RATING: 4 /TEXT: MCU Park is the cozy home ballpark for the local short-season minor league baseball.  Most players in the NY-Penn League had just finished their college baseball careers before joining the cyclones or their opponents.  The atmosphere mixes the nostaglic feel of the Brooklyn Dodgers with the 'kitsch""' of Coney Island into the standard package of Minor League baseball.  The ballpark is by the ocean which tends to keep the temperature cooler than in many other spots in the city.  You can feel comfortable here at a night game even during a heat wave but also a little chilly when it might be a comfortable summer night in the rest of the city.  Don't be afraid to bring a jacket with you.  This stadium also hosts local college baseball games in March April and May.  These games only draw a handful of people; no concessions are open and only the small family bathrooms are open. I went here for a cunyac doubleheader in early April and had a nice afternoon.  Most of the people at these games were parents of the players.  This year(the spring of 2019) there is a major construction project on Surf Avenue which has closed off the nearby streets and also the sidewalks around the ballpark.  This project should be finished by memorial day so it will not impact the minor league season but expect delays and mostly detours, even when walking.  The B36 bus which has a regular stop at the ballpark is rerouted to Mermaid Avenue, a block away. /AUTHOR: Paul Pavlinovich /RATING: 4 /TEXT: Stuck my head in while visiting the area.

Park   R-100,3.6,5,10312,131938,Woodrow Road,Staten+Island," /AUTHOR: attyah rehan /RATING: 2 /TEXT: After going through the whole process of volunteering, application which took about 20 mins and then the interview, my friends and I finally got the OK to volunteer on Mondays since that was the only day we had off from work. However, we then got an email stating they don't need anyone on Monday. Why make people go through the process and then email them 3 days before stating they aren't needed. The guy who interviewed us was really nice. The staff is really nice there. Parking is a bit difficult in that area but if you have time def a place to volunteer.  /AUTHOR: Merrillee Green /RATING: 1 /TEXT:  /AUTHOR: Edrienne C /RATING: 5 /TEXT:  /AUTHOR: Sara Johnette Fitzjohn /RATING: 5 /TEXT:  /AUTHOR: Guadalupe Baez /RATING: 5 /TEXT: ",40.5494,https://www.projecthospitality.org/,-74.179891,https://maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/place/photo?maxwidth=1024&photoreference=CmRaAAAAPtDK1AqP3DwqxHHLt6JPIPVNumcDq6WXll7ai3OiAGrGUig5il_Ppztbu_C6GjnGXeJZO3kMY-cZh6G-SOUxxPW1wR-v0SButx2PX2vZ7CdA47cTJNoGJ1a08gvTB6t-EhCdFoFObMxifMZzwMgA-pZnGhSd635fJHxIXVhEEYuA8rRTlzPUVg&key=AIzaSyBYcuFsV7KTFtJsVKVFcrOEhKYhqpv8V7Y,unknown,Park
